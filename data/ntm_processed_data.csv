Due to the chat session being disconnected, we couldn't communicate further hence I would like to share the summary of our conversation and some further details regarding the concern.  You have created AMI ami-06f9510ad91a91d46 from Instance i-059c44b84a20b51c2 on 2020-09-13 18:31 UTC. But, when you launched Instance i-0762e9f2647798da4 using this created AMI, it was facing 1/2 issue. Hence needed our assistance regarding the same.  Using our internal tools, I have investigated the provided Instance i-0762e9f2647798da4 and could see that this Instance was continuously failing Instance status checks from the time it was launched, which is evident from the graph [1]. Kindly note that there can be many reasons for these Instance status check failures, following are examples of problems that can cause instance status checks to fail:  * Failed system status checks which means there is some issue on the underlying host on which the instance is running. * Incorrect networking or startup configuration * Exhausted memory * Corrupted file system * Incompatible kernel  I investigated the underlying hardware on which the instance i-0762e9f2647798da4 is/was running, but couldn't find anything out of ordinary with them, which is evident from the graph below:  StatusCheckFailed_System: https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/home?region=ap-south-1#metricsV2:graph=~%28region~%27ap-south-1~metrics~%28~%28~%27AWS*2fEC2~%27StatusCheckFailed_System~%27InstanceId~%27i-0762e9f2647798da4%29%29~period~300~stat~%27Sum~start~%272020-09-13T09*3a49*3a28Z~end~%272020-09-14T09*3a49*3a28Z%29  To know more about status check failures please refer the link https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/monitoring-system-instance-status-check.html  I also checked the logs that you provided on the chat session but I was unable to find anything which could give us any idea about the reason for this issue.

You can see a brief summary of our session below.  You reached out to AWS as you were experiencing an issue with changing your instance type from the t2 to the m5 family type.  On our chat session, we managed to change the instance back to its previous type and run the following script [1] that identifies the relevant dependencies for changing your instance type to a Nitro based instance (in this case, an m5.large). After we ran the script, we noticed that the ENA and NVME modules were missing from the instance. To resolve this issue for your particular instance, we ran  the following command to update the package cache and packages for your instance [2]:   $ sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade -y linux-aws   Once this was done, we confirmed that the instance had the modules installed after changing the instance type and running the following commands:   $ modinfo ena  $ modinfo nvme   Another change that we did prior to all of this was update the /etc/fstab entry for the root device of the instance to to use the UUID instead of a label. While it is not bad practice to make use of a label, it preferred to use the UUID of the block device that we are mounting. To find the UUID for the block devices, we ran the following command:   $ sudo lsblk -o +UUID  With regards to the options in fstab, these appear to be related to the type of file system that you are mounting. You can see a few of these options in the following link [3].  Coming back to the odd behavior of the SSH service not starting up. I have done some research and I unfortunately did not find any conclusive evidence for this behavior. This was absolutely strange as we did not make any configuration changes for the ssh service nor did we find any errors in the system logs.

7393100151,Bundl Technologies Private Limited,Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2 - Linux),APAC,INDIA,smotwani,"Hello Sujai  Warm greetings from AWS Premium Support. I am Sunny and it was my pleasure to assist you on chat today. Below I am posting a quick summary of our chat today.  From the case notes I can understand that you were seeing high load average value for the Instance  i-08857c414bff91648 after which the instance became unresponsive and you need to manually stop start the instance to bring it up and running.  I checked the Instance  i-08857c414bff91648 using my internal tools and could see that the instance failed System status check on 2020-09-12 at 12:37 UTC [1]. Upon further checking the issue I can confirm that the underlying hardware on which the Instance was running became unavailable for the same timestamp when the Instance failed System status check. Further I can confirm that the underlying hardware became available after a while and the Instance started passing 2/2 status check and was running up and healthy.  Moving further I can see from the attached screenshot that you were experiencing a high load average for the instance i-08857c414bff91648 after which the instance became unresponsive and you need to manually stop start the instance to bring it up and running.  For this issue I checked the CPU Utilization for the Instance and could see that the CPU Utilization was quite low during the same timestamp when a high load average was experienced. [2]  Please allow me explain about the load average and its relation with CPU Utilization  In Linux, the load average is basically the combination of threads running on the CPU, threads waiting in the run queue to get on the CPU and process waiting for IO to complete. The three numbers in the load average is the average of these parameters over 1, 5 and 15 minute respectively.  Whereas the CPU utilization is basically an indication that how much percentage of time in a given time interval the CPU was busy doing some work.  So, considering above definition, it can be interpreted that we can have high load average even when CPU utilization of the server is low.","Sep 17, 2020",RE:[CASE 7393100151] Chat: Instance went unhealthy,"September 17, 2020 10:59:33",1,sujai greeting load average start tool hardware hardware screenshot load average start utilization utilization load average load average relation utilization average combination thread thread run que io load average average parameter utilization indication percentage work definition load average utilization

It was pleasure talking to you on the chat session. Below is the summary of our discussion.  Chat Summary ===========  • You reached out to us because you were facing issues while trying to upgrade your Windows Server 2008 R2 to Windows Server 2012 R2.  • Using the parent EC2 instance you created an AMI by first removing it from domain and adding it to Workgroup.  • Using the AMI you launched a new EC2 instance, which started to fail its instance status checks and you weren't able to connect to it via RDP.  • Further, we connected over screenshare session and quickly attached the secondary ENI post which instance started to pass its health checks (2/2).  • But post attaching the secondary ENI even then also the instance was not reachable.  • We then performed EC2 Rescue and Diagnose operation where we found that instance had DHCP disabled and was static IPv4 address assigned.  • We enabled it by rescuing the instance and also enabled EC2 User Data since you mentioned you had no local admin user credentials to RDP.  • We passed below powerShell commands in the user data to create a local admin user -      <powershell>     net user TestUser TestP@ss@123 /add     net localgroup administrators Administrator /add     net localgroup ""Remote Desktop Users"" Administrator /add     net localgroup administrators TestUser /add     net localgroup ""Remote Desktop Users"" TestUser /add           </powershell>  • After passing the user data we started the instance and after few minutes I confirmed from the backend that the instance is up and running.  • Instance has passed both the health checks and I see OS has booted up to the Ctrl+Alt+Del screen as can be seen in the instance console screenshot.  • When I asked you to try RDP, suddenly the chat and screenshare session got disconnected.  • There might be some networking concern at your end and thus we got disconnected.  • I'd request you to please initiate the chat again so that we can continue ou","Sep 18, 2020",RE:[CASE 7397310041] Chat: unable to login to server,"September 18, 2020 12:00:10",2,shruti greeting discussion parent domain rdp eni post health post eni rescue operation dhcp admin credential rdp power shell admin powershell test p localgroup administrator localgroup remote desktop localgroup administrator localgroup remote desktop minute backend health screen screenshot rdp screenshare concern

7404999731,Tata Communications Ltd.,Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2 - Linux),APAC,INDIA,tsstock,"Hello,  Thank you for contacting AWS Premium Support. My name is Tobias and I will be assisting you with this case today.  I understand you are having issues with various basic commands on your EC2 instance i-0784cc443146dc06d after a crash.  In summary, since Linux is not able to find basic commands like ""ls"", the problem is located on the operating system itself. If the problem only exists on this EC2 instance and you are able to launch working instances from the AMI (ami-03cb31cacba9daff0) without problems, you can simply replace the instance with a new one in the auto scaling group. Please read on for further details and troubleshooting steps.  The instance itself is passing health checks, which is why there is no issue on the underlying hardware and the operating system is also responding to network requests.[1][2] The CPU usage continually rises after launch to peak at 100%, which is a reason for concern and does impact the general usability of the instance.[3]  The instance is part of the auto scaling group (ASG) PWALuxMsiteqa8ASG and launched via the AMI ami-03cb31cacba9daff0. You can try to launch a new instance from the AMI to determine, if the AMI itself is able to launch a new and working EC2 instance.  Usually, the ASG does replace an unhealthy instance itself, but since the scaling processes ""ReplaceUnhealthy"" and ""HealthCheck"" are suspended, ASG does not act upon the configured ELB health checks.[4] Please resume the processes to reenable the basic ASG functionality, should the AMI work without issues as mentioned above.  For further troubleshooting of the impaired instance, you can detach the EBS root volume vol-0a69146524e4b60a0 of the instance to check for the root cause and attach it to another EC2 ""rescue"" instance and mount it.[5][6]  You can check the following on the EBS volume, which are possible starting points for investigation:  - <mountpoint>/var/log/messages - the general file system structure under <mountpoint>/ including <mountpoint>/usr/bin/ and <mountpoint>/dev/ - permissions on ","Sep 21, 2020",RE:[CASE 7404999731] Instance stopped working,"September 21, 2020 11:33:18",3,crash problem operating problem problem auto health hardware operating usage launch concern usability auto pwalux asg scaling health asg elb health asg functionality work troubleshooting rescue point investigation mountpoint structure mountpoint mountpoint mountpoint permission

7409249291,Hotstar (Star TV India),Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2 - Linux),APAC,INDIA,charbaah,"Hello Alisha,  It was a pleasure working with your on the case.  You indicated of applying the recommendation provided by my previous colleague on both Amazon Linux 1 and Amazon Linux 2. The recommendation worked on Amazon Linux 2 but failed on Amazon Linux 1 as you were unable to login with a password on the newly launched instance using the AMI taking from an instance configured for password authentication.  To resolve the issue, the cloud init file; 00_defaults.cfg, located in the directory path ""/etc/cloud/cloud.cfg.d"" was edited and the following changes were made:  [A] The directive ssh_pwauth was changed from false to true: - ssh_pwauth: true  [B] The directive lock_passwd for the ec2-user under the section ""default_user:"" was set to false.  - lock_passwd: false  [C] In the /etc/ssh/sshd_config file, the PasswordAuthentication directive was set to yes.  On performing the above actions and taking an AMI of the instance, you successfully gained access to the newly launched instance using the same password from the original instance.  For Ubuntu 16 and 18, the file to edit is /etc/cloud/cloud.cfg. The directives should be provided in the file as highlighted above. The lock_passwd directive can be set to false for the Ubuntu user. For CentOS 7 the changes should also be carried out in the /etc/cloud/cloud.cfg file. Set the ssh_pwauth to 1 and the lock_passwd under the centos user to false. Similar configuration should apply to CentOS 8, RHEL 7 as well RHEL 8.  You indicated the case status can be set to resolved. I will proceed in doing same, however should you have any follow up questions, please do not hesitate to contact me via the case correspondence. I will be more than willing to assist further.

7430372811,Mylan,Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2 - Linux),APAC,INDIA,coferrar,"Hi Dave, sorry for the delay.  The over 1000 Describe* per minute were just a example of the overall high volume. In regards to the 100 per second, this is what you can burst up to in a single second assuming the Request Token Bucket bucket is full. Looking at the document here [1], we can see the bucket refill rate for Describe* is 20 per second. This means if you were to use past 20 Describe* calls for several seconds in a row, you could still deplete the Request Token Bucket.   For example, out bucket starts at 100 token. If we have 40 Describe* calls per second for 5 seconds in a row, we will deplete the bucket as we are asking for 20 additional calls over the baseline refill rate (also 20). Since credits refill at 20 per second, the 40 Describe* calls per second can only be maintained for 5 consecutive seconds.   Looking at your CloudTrail, this is what is happening here. The DescribeImageAttribute calls is around mid 20's on average every second, but for several consecutive minutes, so the Request Token Bucket is still being depleted as the request call rate is above the refill rate of 20 per second.    Once you reduce the number of these DescribeImageAttribute calls, your RequestLimitExceeded errors will disappear. Please let me know if you have any further questions.   We value your feedback.

Please find a brief summary of our discussion below:  You reached out to us as you were unable to connect to the instance:  i-0bc39a0a47cf44f27 from i-063f9ea9b9b16b33a. While we were on chat you rebooted the instance and then you were able to connect to it. I informed you that the CPU Utilization of the instance has been above baseline of 20% (for t2.small) and out of 2G of memory 332M  was free (after the instance was rebooted). So, it might be possible that the instance was not responding due to resource crunch. However, the root volume of the instance looks fine. You may consider installing command line monitoring tools like atop[1] on the instance which log resource usage, hence if the issue occurs again in future we will be able to check the resource consumption and find out the probable cause of the issue.  Further, as discussed, I would be marking this case as resolved and in case you have any other concerns, you can always reach out to us via a new support case and we would be more than glad to assist you.  ===================  Resource:  [1] https://www.tecmint.com/how-to-install-atop-to-monitor-logging-activity-of-linux-system-processes/  We value your feedback.

7441718491,Dream11 Fantasy Private Limited,Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2 - Linux),APAC,INDIA,saskk,"Hi Harsimran Singh,  Thanks for your response.  I understand you are not able to perform capacity planning due to the discrepancy in the CPU utilization data. You had some previous events where the instances were unresponsive due to load. I am providing my suggestion to handle such scenarios.  When the instance was unresponsive, we need to investigate from the low level data. I mean the CPU utilization factor for each process that runs inside the instances. In other words, instead of relying on the high level graphs (both CloudWatch and third-party tools), you must look at the low level per-process utilization data.  Another aspect when an instance is scaled down to half of its size, there are chances that the instance is loosing performance in all resources such as CPU, Memory, Network and EBS performance. So it is really important to pin-point which exact resource is causing the unresponsiveness.  Hence, we need to investigate more with respect to the performance investigation at the Instance/Operating System level.  Since it is not possible to manually perform real time monitoring at the Operating System level, I would suggest you to install ""atop"" and ""sar"" system tool that would log all the relevant system information continuously so that if such an issue occurs again, we would have historical data to analyze. Based on the investigation with the ""atop"" and ""sar"" logs we could get more insights about the CPU performance and eliminate the cause.   - SAR to collect, report, or save system activity information.  - ATOP shows which processes are responsible for the indicated load with respect to cpu- and memory load on process level.  Please install ""atop"" tool on the instance which is a full screen performance monitor that can report the activity of all processes, even the ones that have been completed. ""atop"" also allows you to keep daily log of system activities. For installing ATOP and SAR, please follow below steps. These steps are tailored for the Operating System (CentOS 7) you use in the instance 'i-0fd1","Sep 30, 2020",RE:[CASE 7441718491] CPU metrics,"October 1, 2020 7:22:37",3,harsimran singh response capacity discrepancy utilization suggestion scenario utilization factor word graph utilization aspect half size chance performance resource memory performance resource hence respect performance investigation monitoring operating tool investigation atop insight performance sar report activity atop show load respect memory load tool screen performance monitor activity one atop activity atop operating

You can see a summary of our conversation below.  You reached out to AWS as you wanted to know the reason for your AMI taking a long time to create.  As discussed on our chat session, there were no issues with the AMI being created as the snapshot for the root volume was still being created. Because this was a large volume and a snapshot was not created in a long time, it can sometimes take a while for a snapshot to be created.  Looking at the AMI ami-09f8b2cb12bc81c53 at this time, I can see that it has successfully completed.  I have closed this case however, if you have any other questions or concerns, please feel to open a new case with us at any time.  Wishing you a pleasant day further.  We value your feedback.

With regards to your query about reducing an EBS volume size; in AWS the size of an EBS volume can only be increased, not decreased. On a best effort, I've went on and replicated the steps in my Ubuntu test environment as below.  1. Requirements: a) Created an instance with a 3 TiB volume size (which holds less than 8 GiB of data in it) b) Created an empty volume of 8 GiB in size in the EC2 console  c) Created a temporary Ubuntu instance to be used as a recovery instance d) Detached the 3 TiB volume from its instance and attached it to the recovery instance as /dev/xvdf d) Attached the newly created empty 8 GiB volume to this recovery instance as /dev/xvdg  2. Used fdisk to create a root partition on the 8 GiB GB disk as below: $ sudo fdisk /dev/xvdg     Command : n     Select : p     Partition number : <Enter for default options>     First sector : <Enter for default options>     Last sector, +sectors or +size{K,M,G} : <Enter for default options>     Command : w     The partition table has been altered!     Calling ioctl() to re-read partition table.     Syncing disks.  3. Ran lsblk to make sure new partition on 8 GiB volume is detected: $ sudo lsblk     NAME    MAJ:MIN RM   SIZE RO TYPE MOUNTPOINT     xvda    202:0    0     8G  0 disk     └─xvda1 202:1    0     8G  0 part /     xvdf    202:80   0     3T  0 disk     └─xvdf1 202:81   0     3T  0 part     xvdg    202:96   0     8G  0 disk     └─xvdg1 202:97   0     8G  0 part  4. Created a filesystem on the partition created in the previous step by executing: $ sudo mkfs.ext4 /dev/xvdg1  5. Created temporary mount points on the temporary instance by typing: $ sudo mkdir /new /old  6. Mounted the volumes to the temporary mount points, here /dev/xvdf1 is 3000 GiB partition and /dev/xvdg1 is 8 GiB partition: $ sudo mount /dev/xvdf1 /old $ sudo mount /dev/xvdg1 /new  7.

This is a summary of our chat session.  You had reached out regarding multiple spot instances termination in your account in ap-southeast-1a.  On checking we found that it was due to high surge in on-demand usage that led to capacity crunch in ap-southeast-1a AZ for r4.4xlarge, r5.4xlarge, m5.8xlarge, r5a.4xlarge, and r5d.4xlarge instance types.  So the instances got terminated with error code ""instance-terminated-no-capacity"" due to no capacity for these instance types in ap-southeast-1a AZ at that particular time.  As the ASG: spot-16-128-r5-4x-a.k8s2.oyorooms.io with these instances is configured for a single AZ ap-southeast-1a, I had suggested you to consider multi-AZ ASG configuration that would ensure more capacity reliability.  As discussed I'm marking the case as closed. Please feel free to open a new case for any further queries and we'll be happy to address you.  Have a lovely day ahead.  We value your feedback.

7471683311,Hotstar (Star TV India),Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2 - Windows),APAC,INDIA,keegav,"Hello,  We have increased the disk space of EC2 instance and our instance is a nitro instance. Disk space is not fully expanded in the system and unable to allocate the remaining portion of the disk space from disk management utility.  Initially, we had 1TB root volume. We have added 3TB space to that. We were able to expand the root disk up to 2TB and unable to extend the root disk to the maximum storage capacity. 2TB disk space remains unallocated.  To fix the above issue, we tried to install NVMe driver for our windows server by following the driver installation document. https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/WindowsGuide/aws-nvme-drivers.html  We expected the instance will be rebooted and after that disk space will be fully expanded as expected.

Also the secondary volume vol-0550a24419dc08bd7 there were no operations being performed.  4. Additionally,  digging deeper I noticed that there was a transient network packet drop at the hardware level during the mentioned timeframe, so all the packets coming from outside was not reaching the instance. Seems like it has caused you some inconvenience which will be due to this. On behalf of AWS apologies for the same.  Checking the network packet for next 24 hours, I did not observe the packets being dropped again, so it seems to be fine.  Conclusion, yes there was a transient network packet drop at the hardware level which might have caused issue to your business during the mentioned timeframe.   I hope the above information helps, if you have any additional questions or concerns or if there is some other query, then please feel free to reach out for further assistance.

7484195981,Zapr (Red Brick Lane),Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2 - Linux),APAC,INDIA,edcaldas,"Hello,  Eden here again, from AWS Premium Support.  I am so sorry that instance i-034b9930a15abbcd3 was stopped and retired. I reviewed the instance's logs using our internal tools and confirmed that it happened due to the underlying hardware being marked as degraded and scheduled for retirement.  An EC2 instance is scheduled for retirement when Amazon Web Services (AWS) detects an irreparable failure in the infrastructure that's hosting your instance. When this happens, an email is sent to you, the Personal Health Dashboard indicates the scheduling, and the AWS EC2 Console also holds this information in EC2 under ""Scheduled events"". You are required to stop and then start the instance at your preferred time before the instance retirement date. Stopping and starting the instance moves the instance to another healthy host.   More information regarding scheduled retirement here[1]. More on stopping spot instances here[2].  Hardware failures don't happen often, but as we know, hardware and networking equipment will never enjoy 100% up time, and from time to time system failures will happen. We make every commercially available effort to make sure Amazon Web Services is secure and resilient, giving you reliability at massive scale. Since, hardware and network failures will inevitably occur in any environment, we encourage you to design your applications in AWS platform accordingly[3].  Moreover, It is always best practice to keep the backup copy of your instance either in the form of AMI[4] or snapshot[5] of the volume. It is easier to recover an instance from the snapshot or AMI during an instance or volume failure, or even in the event of data accidentally lost.  Once again our sincere apologies, please let me know if there is something else that I can do to assist in this case.  Have a great day ahead!

It was a real pleasure speaking you earlier today and here is a recap of our conversation.  You reached out because you were unable to RDP to the instance i-072b55b61864f349b.  During the screen-share session, we tested and confirmed that we were able to telnet on port 3389, meaning the instance is listening on that port however we were still unable RDP using its Elastic IP :52.66.85.94  We tried  a different EIP and you were able RDP into the instance.  When I researched about this , I noticed that there is an issue reported with RDP over some of EIP when traffic is open to all. Now this issue is being investigated internally with no permanent solution as of now. Since you couldn't change the instance EIP for business reasons, you changed the RDP port number from 3389 to 24579. You also added an inbound rule for port 24579 on the SG""sg-6ee71407"". After rebooting the instance , you were able to successfully RDP into the instance using this EIP :52.66.85.94  For your convenience, here are the few workarounds provided by the Service Team for this issue.  1. Disassociate EIP and use the default public address.  2. Restrict port 3389 in the security group.  Restrict the RDP access to specific CIDR's rather than it being open to the world (0.0.0.0/0) as it is subject to cause DDoS attacks.  We restricted the port 3389 to known IP address, however  you were still unable to RDP using the Elastic IP :52.66.85.94  3. Try setting a local policy as below:[1]   1. RDP to the server and start the registry editor. (Type regedit in the Search box.)  2.  Navigate to the following registry subkey: HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\System\CurrentControlSet\Control\Terminal Server\WinStations\RDP-Tcp\PortNumber  3. Click Edit > Modify, and then click Decimal.  4. Type the new port number, and then click OK.  5. Close the registry editor, and restart your computer.

My name is Philip and I will assist you with this case.  I understand that you would like to set IST as the default timezone for all new EC2 instance launches.  EC2 instances in all regions launch with UTC as their timezone. You may change the timezone setting during launch with a User Data [1] bash script with the timedatectl command [2]. Please view my example script below. To launch an instance with this script you need to define it on the ""Configure Instance"" step of the launch wizard, or alternatively in the launch template that you intend to use.  In the instance launch wizard, step 3 ""Configure Instance"" contains a User Data field. For Launch Templates, the User Data field is in the ""Advanced details"" section of the Create Launch Template form.

You contacted as, you were facing issues while connecting to EC2 instance i-0077f87baf10a56bf through SSM. Below I will provide the summary of our conversation.  -This instance was launched from ami-0c2dd038498bab169 AMI which is having default user ""clckwrk""[1] -While connecting through putty using clckwrk user you were getting connection refused error. Upon checking we were able to identify that permission on the home directory of this user was incorrectly set and after correcting those permission you were able to login successfully. -Next I was able find that instance was not attached with necessary IAM role required to connect with SSM service, hence we associated required role with this instance.[2] -Next we also upgraded and restarted the SSM agent, as per [3] document. -After this, instance was showing under managed instance console. -However upon starting session with session manager, we were getting below message.  ""The instance is not running a version of SSM Agent that supports Session Manager. Update SSM Agent on the instance to version 2.3.68.0 or later.""  -Next, we used auto-update option on SSM console to upgrade the SSM agent to 3.0.222.0 version.  As discussed over call, you should be able to connect to this instance through SSM now, in case if you face any issue, do not hesitate to reach back to me through this case.  I trust information provided above will help you.   Have a nice day ahead !

7515873421,IBS Software Pvt Ltd,Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2 - Linux),APAC,INDIA,jdavismk,"Hello,  Thank you for contacting AWS support. I hope you are well. My name is Joe, and I will be assisting with your case today.   I understand you experienced an instance status check failure on one of your instances i-05c7cdc5227476596. Instance status check failures generally denote an issue at the operating system level and require your involvement to fix.   Your instance's CPU usage, and its EBS Burst Balance's both seem normal, as such for further troubleshooting, I would ask that use the Red Hat sosreport tool to create an archive of the logs files. I will outline how to do so below.    1. Create a snapshot of the instance's root volume.    2. Create a new volume from that snapshot.    3. Attach that volume to another, working, rescue instance. For example, as device /dev/sdf.    4.

Thank you for reaching out to AWS Premium Support with your question about how to restore file permissions that were incorrectly configured.  On our chat you mentioned that you ran the following commands into order to create a ""read only user""       useradd read-user       passwd read-user       chmod a=r /dev/xvda2       chmod a=r /home       chmod a=r /var       chmod a=r /var/log/       chmod a=r /var/log/audit/       chmod a=r /tmp/       chmod a=r /wasnd/       chmod 700 /root/       chmod 700 /dev/xvda2 The above ""chmod"" commands changed the permissions on some important directories and files using by the services on Linux. This is not a good idea as it can cause damage to the OS. It is also a good idea to a take snapshot of the instance volumes prior to make such changes as the damage could unreversed-able.   I provided the following commands to correctly configure the permissions for the ones that were changed:       chmod 0660 /dev/xvda2       chmod 0755 /home       chmod 0755 /var       chmod 0755 /var/log/       chmod 0700 /var/log/audit/       chmod 1777 /tmp/       chmod 0755 /wasnd/       chmod 550 /root/  After you executed the above commands you were able to login again via ""putty"".   From the case you described, where you would like to give a user only read access and no execute, please understand the a unprivileged(normal) user is only allowed to make changes on files that that user is the owner of, and no other files. That user will also not have read rights on certain files.  To give the ""read-only"" user rights on only certain file you can use the ""Linux File Access Control List""(FACL) feature. This feature allow for allocation of certain permissions on files/directories to users, and can be used to limit access for those users.  To allocate the ""read"" permission to a folder/file the user ""read-user"", you can user the ""setfacl"" c","Oct 21, 2020",RE:[CASE 7515954991] Chat: unable to retake server access via putty,"October 21, 2020 10:17:51",2,permission order read passwd chmod chmod chmod chmod chmod chmod chmod chmod chmod permission directory idea damage o idea take snapshot change damage permission one chmod chmod chmod chmod chmod chmod chmod putty change owner control list feature feature allocation permission permission setfacl c

Both of these instances appear to have been launched from vanilla SLES 12 SP1 images for SAP related workloads. General support for SLES 12 SP1 ended on 05/31/2017. With the vanilla SLES (non-sap images) the customers cannot sit on a SP version and expect support or repository access. Once a new service pack comes out, the previous SP is only supported for 6 months to allow time to migrate to the new SP release. At this current point in time SLES 12 SP5 is the most recent SP release.  You can check the same here:   - https://www.suse.com/lifecycle/  It appears that you have an old versions (pre 9.0) of cloud-regionsrv-client and cloud-regionsrv-client-plugin-ec2 installed on the instances.   As a work-around for this, you may follow the steps mentioned the SUSE documents, to see if the late instance gets the access to the repos to be able to update. Please note the below steps may not work on SLES 12 SP1 as it was already out of general support when the late_instance_offline_update_ec2 was made available and there's a possibility that the SLES 12 SP1 may no longer be available.      - https://www.suse.com/de-de/support/kb/doc/?id=000019633     - https://www.suse.com/c/a-new-update-infrastructure-for-the-public-cloud/  I have also mentioned steps here for your reference that you may refer to:  ------------------------------------ NOTE: It is recommended to ry these steps on a test instance and then only apply to the production environment.

It was nice talking to you today and here I would like to share the summary of our conversation.  You were having 1/2 status check failures for the Instance i-0066189de591fbf21 and needed to know the reason and resolution for the same. Hence needed our assistance regarding this.  Using our Internal tools, I was able to see that the Instance was passing both the status checks during the time I reviewed the same, but it has been failing Instance status checks multiple times which is evident from the graph [1]. As mentioned on the chat, there can be many reasons for these Instance status check failures, following are examples of problems that can cause instance status checks to fail:  * Failed system status checks due to issue with Underlying hardware on which Instance is running * Incorrect networking or startup configuration * Exhausted memory * Corrupted file system * Incompatible kernel  I investigated the underlying hardware on which the instance is/was running, but couldn't find anything out of ordinary with them, which is evident from the graph [2]. To know more about status check failures please refer the link https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/monitoring-system-inst****-******-*****.html  I have also checked the CPU Utilization [3] for this Instance it seems to have spiked to 100% multiple times. Moreover, I have checked the Stats of root EBS volume and could see that the read ops were exceeding its baseline limits mostly which can be seen from the graph [4]. This has also exhausted the burstbalance for this EBS volume multiple time and have also increased the queuelength, respective graphs are [5][6].  From this observation it seems that your application is requesting more workload than the Instance and the EBS volume can provide. Therefore, in case of such issue we usually recommend our customers to use monitoring tools such as ATOP, SAR and IOSTAT which will help you to understand what is going on during the time of issue and which","Oct 30, 2020",RE:[CASE 7554354901] Chat: Instance struck on 1/2 status,"October 30, 2020 10:49:25",4,rinkesh sajid conversation resolution hence assistance tool graph example problem hardware networking startup memory kernel hardware anything graph utilization stats ops baseline limit graph burstbalance quelength graph observation workload monitoring tool sar iostat

You came through requesting how to setup public key authentication on two resources.  In short have provided the two options that you can use when trying to achieve this using Public key authentication.  Method 1 - use the same keys on the servers: Convert the keys to openssh format and upload the private keys to the servers. When you ssh to the destination host, specify the private key file: ssh -i mykey.pem .ip.of.other.server  Method 2 - Create new keys On each server run: ssh-keygen   Hit enter enter enter. You'll have two files: .ssh/id_rsa .ssh/id_rsa.pub  On Server A, cat and copy to clipboard the public key: cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub [select and copy to your clipboard]  On server B [The client], and append the contents of that to the it's authorized_keys file: cat >> ~/.ssh/authorized_keys [paste your clipboard contents] [ctrl+d to exit]  Now ssh from server A: ssh -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa ip/.of.other.server  The customer already provided you with his Public key, you need to append it to the relevant users .ssh/authorized_keys. You only need to share the public key of the user you created to the client. He needs to add this key in his ~/.ssh/authorized_keys. Please confirm the user the client will use to login to your instance. You to need to ensure that the client/you has the following directory structure created.  On the client machine: /home/aero-user/.ssh/authorized_keys [Client to append your public key in here]  On the your machine machine /home/client-user/.ssh/authorized_keys [append the clients public key in here]  You can lookup the relevant ssh permissions for your directory in the following third party article:  https://superuser.com/questions/215504/permissions-on-private-key-in-ssh-folder  Above is a short example of the methods that can used to ensure public key authentication.

Depending on the VPN you are using you need to get the proper network card and perform the capture on it. for instance in my case I have to go here ""Control Panel\Network and Internet\Network Connections"" then the card for the VPN is ""Cisco AnyConnect Secure Mobility Client Connection"".  Because the wireshark on the server is not working the other solution is to use AWS traffic mirroring [1] [2]. So you will have to clone the traffic from and towards this instance and send it to another instance. On the other instance you will be able to run a packet capture like tcpdump (linux) or wireshark (windows). But we can do it together if you prefer.  Thanks for your understanding.

I will be sharing a brief summary of our discussion below:  I understand that you were unable to login to your instance i-09e3bae728e72f7ea due to the following error: WARNING: Your password has expired. You must change your password now and login again! Changing password for conman.  This occurs because there is password aging policy in your /etc/login.defs which expires the password - so we had to manually edit this setting to make sure that the password never expire.  We then checked that SSM agent is running on the instance, so we added an instance profile to allow EC2 to access the SSM endpoint - though this was not picked up immediately, we rebooted the server to ensure the SSM agent starts up properly. After reboot, we were able to access the instance via SSM.  We then ran the following command to ensure the password never expires: $ sudo chage -m 0 -M 99999 conman  Confirmed the settings via: $ sudo chage -l conman  You were then able to successfully access the instance via SSH.  I hope this was of help to you. As discussed, I shall be marking this case as resolved. Please feel free to reach out in case of any further queries. I will be more than happy to help.

7576617951,RBL Bank Limited,Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2 - Linux),APAC,INDIA,rakshc,"Hi Shruti,  Thank you for your valuable time on chat and screenshare session today. Please find a brief summary of our discussion below:  You reached out to us as you were unable to resize the partition size to 5.9 TB after increasing the volume size. On screenshare, I saw that you have MBR based partitions which limits the partition size to 2TB. Hence, growpart increased the partition size to 2TB only. I informed you that you can convert MBR to GPT but it is a very risky operation and can lead to data loss as well. You mentioned that you don't want to touch the existing volumes and you would like to create one logical partition of size 5.9T on a new volume. Hence, we created a logical volume of the desired size on a new volume and mounted it on the instance.  Further, as discussed, I would be marking this case as resolved and in case you have any other concerns, you can always reach out to us via a new support case and we would be more than glad to assist you.

I have worked with the service team on your query and I believe to have found an answer for your query.  The reason that it appears that we are not setting system limits when probing ""ulimit -a"" in the user data script is due to the fact that the  cloud-init service is started by systemd and will not show the limits defined for root user as it doesn't involve login and invocation of PAM.  Building on this, in the man page for ""limits.conf"", we can see the following:   Also, please note that all limit settings are set per login. They are not global, nor are they permanent; existing only for the duration of the session.   All this being said, systemd services do not respect limits.conf the same way as processes running by login shells and probing ""ulimit -a"" in user data is not going to provide us with the information we need.  Lastly, I have provided you with a document below that discusses how to set limits for services run by systemd which I trust will prove useful to you.

7589624191,ALL_DEPRECATED,Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2 - Linux),APAC,INDIA,adipo,"Hello Sanchit,  This is Millicent from AWS Premium support again. It was a pleasure talking with you on chat  earlier today.  You reached out to us today as you were not able to start your spot instance ID 'i-0d23bac71f3e95e26' and you are getting the error "" You can't start the Spot Instance  because it is in a fleet, which does not support start.   From our internal tools, I could see that the request was failing at this point as there is no Spot capacity available that matches your request. As I explained such an alarm is usually generated when there are not enough unused EC2 instances to meet the demand for Spot Instances. Normally, Spot instances take advantage of unused EC2 capacity in the AWS cloud.  Based on our documentation [1] the “InsufficientInstanceCapacity” error is received when “AWS does not currently have enough available On-Demand capacity to service a request.” The same document suggests some solutions for this as below:  1. Wait a few minutes and then submit your request again. 2. Submit a new request with a reduced number of instances. ( For example, a single request to launch 15 instances, can be replaced by 3 requests for 5 instances, or 15 requests for 1 instance instead. 3. Submit a new request without specifying an Availability Zone 4. Submit a new request using a different instance type (which you can resize at a later stage)  In this case, we checked again after sometime now, the request has been fulfilled and your instance was back online. For the long term to mitigate such issues, we discussed that you could consider using On-Demand capacity to ensure to ensure that you always have instance capacity [2].   I trust this correspondence proves useful. I will proceed to mark the case as resolved as agreed. Should you have any other questions or need additional clarification, please feel free to get back to us and we will be happy to assist you.

As per the failed Curl outputs, the error was HTTP 522 which is a server side error and hence it means that the traffic successfully reached to the server but the server did not reply to the client due to some (origin) dependancy.    The destination seems to be Cloudflare which is a CDN (Just like Cloudfront) out of scope of AWS.  As the error reports, the connection to the origin configured in the Cloudflare itself was timed out. Since, this is out of AWS, we were unable to know the root cause for the same but it is confirmed that the traffic successfully reached to cloudflare servers.

After the chat we had yesterday, I have reached out to your TAM to get more information regarding your cross account support. TAM has created an internal ticket now to allow support for the account 101531708582 and this is approved. So we can continue our discussion about this issue.   Based on the error message you have provided and case description, I understand that you were able to create instances without any issues, however when you are trying to describe the instances, you are getting the error ""InvalidInstanceID.NotFound"". Please feel free to correct me if this is not the issue.   I have checked the request ID (4f86545c-0943-4793-a37e-cf9d43e008a4) in the logs you have provided and I could see that this request ID is for an API call to desrcibe the instance i-04df63738c69d96b2.   While checking the instance creation time and time of DescribeInstances API call, I could see that the time at which these two calls were made are close and I believe this resulted in InvalidInstanceID.NotFound error.   -------- RunInstances   2020-11-09T17:06:08.000Z  cloud trail event ID :  ec0e7323-8173-4491-a4cd-de1febea5a2f   DescribeInstances   2020-11-09T17:06:08.000Z  cloud trail event ID : 17d1c727-72d3-418d-9664-2cd07a7ccde1  --------  If this is the issue, I would like to inform you that Amazon EC2 API follows an eventual consistency model. This means that the result of an API call you ran must not be immediately visible to the subsequent commands you run. For example, if you ran a API call or command to create a resource, and you run another API call immediately for modifying or describing that resource, its ID might not propagated through the system and you will get an error that says resource does not exist.  This has to be kept in mind when you run an API call that immediately follows another API.  This can be managed by : 1. Add wait time between subsequent commands.  2. Confirm the state of the resource before you run a command to modify it.

It was a pleasure speaking with you over the call earlier today.  You reached out to us today as your instance ID 'i-09aa3eaf062fb9191' is failing status check 1/2.  During our screen share session today, we observed that the instance is stuck at GRUB menu list prompting for OS selection to boot, however no further errors were reported in system console logs. Therefore we attempted to recover to last known stale kernel as per our guide here [1], however this is still failing.  On further inspection, we have noted that the vmlinuz is missing in the /boot partition, as explained Vmlinuz file is the name of Linux kernel executable , by other word its a compressed Linux kernel and it is bootable . Vmlinuz is normally located in /boot directory , it may be the actual kernel executable or a link to the real one.  Therefore we need to rebuild the kernel and we agreed we shall continue tomorrow at 1130 IST.

You can take a look here:  https://ap-south-1.console.aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/home?region=ap-south-1#metricsV2:graph=~(view~'timeSeries~stacked~false~metrics~(~(~'AWS*2fEC2~'StatusCheckFailed~'InstanceId~'i-0249d9a6cc0df911d))~region~'ap-south-1~start~'-P3D~end~'P0D);query=~'*7bAWS*2fEC2*2cInstanceId*7d*20i-0249d9a6cc0df911d  That implies that there were no hardware failures on the underlying host that this instance is hosted on, as well as any connectivity issues at the OS level which would have caused this behavior.  I did see that the CPU Utilization exceeded 99.3% on the instance roughly 12 hours ago, and since that was the time when you opened the case, this could be a possibility why you were not able to telnet or curl that we can explore.   You can take a look here: https://ap-south-1.console.aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/home?region=ap-south-1#metricsV2:graph=~(view~'timeSeries~stacked~false~region~'ap-south-1~start~'-P1D~end~'P0D~metrics~(~(~'AWS*2fEC2~'CPUUtilization~'InstanceId~'i-0249d9a6cc0df911d)));query=~'*7bAWS*2fEC2*2cInstanceId*7d*20i-0249d9a6cc0df911d  The CPU was above 99.3% from 2020-11-12 12:10 UTC (5:40 pm IST) till 2020-11-12 12:20 UTC (5:50 pm)  Then, I took a look at all the attached volumes and could find that there was consistent Write activity going on the instance, but nothing concerning since it did not cross any limits. That can be seen from the BurstBalance remaining intact all throughout.

Thank you for reaching out to AWS Premium Support with your question about why you are unable to access port 25 on your on-prem server(IP address of 10.60.0.124) from the ec2 instance (i-02437d04d67ba930d), port 25 has been enabled.   I can confirm that I did not see any presents of throttling on port 25 on the instance id provided, so the cause of the issue you are experiencing most likely relates to network routing.

You reached out to AWS because you were unable to upgrade packages due to network unreachable error and needed assistance to fix the issue.  Looking at your instance i-08b15a68378315fa6 using our internal tools, I could see that the default route 0.0.0.0/0 was pointing to the Internet Gateway (IGW) igw-44519521 without a public or elastic IP address. This was the issue, to route the traffic via IGW the instance needs a public or elastic IP address [1].  Having that said, I advised the following options to solve the issue:   • Route the default route to NAT Gateway or instance or proxy configured etc [2]   • Create an AMI from the current instance and relaunch a new instance with the option ""Auto-assign Public"" enabled, so that the new instance will have a public IP address [3]   • Allocate elastic IP address to the instance [4]. Please note an Elastic IP address comes at no cost when it is associated with a running instance.  You allocated an elastic IP address to the instance and you could upgrade the packages.  As agreed, I will be marking the case resolved. If you have other queries, please feel free to open up new case.   Have a good day!

I am writing to give you a summary of our chat.  You reached out to AWS because you would like to upgrade your HTTPd to the latest version (2.4.46) on your RHEL 7 (i-08346b19797bd22a2).  While on the chat, I explained that the version on the official repos, they are the versions that went testing and approval. Even though, the latest version normally has new features and fixes bugs, you may face some operating system issues [1, 2]. Let me explain some disadvantages of manually installing the Apache 2.4.46 version:   • Apache package dependency issues can be encountered  • Internal Apache Configuration file mismatch   • Issue can be encountered while trying to run the HTTPd binary file  As I could not just provide the procedure without testing from my end, I launched an RHEL 7 and followed the below procedure to upgrade the HTTPd version.   1. Create a snapshot [3] or AMI [4] of the instance, which would serve as backup before making any changes/updates  2. Remove the installed package ...   $ httpd -v   Server version: Apache/2.4.6 (Red Hat Enterprise Linux)   Server built:   Oct  8 2020 21:27:40   $ sudo -s   # yum remove httpd  3.

The current process followed is to configure an access key and secret key using aws configure and then use aws CLI to list S3 objects or use the boto3 python library to programmatically traverse through S3 bucket hierarchy.  Since static access keys and secret keys are a security risk, in order to update keys we 1) rotate keys or 2) use ada tool (https://w.amazon.com/bin/view/DevAccount/Docs). This solution isn't very usable since it requires constant key updates, syncing between laptop and EC2 and finally aws credentials changes.  Question: How do we interface with S3 from EC2 without using secret key and access key?   Characteristics of the solution required: - No static secret key and access key - No manual secret key and access key update - No sync between laptop / EC2 - Can directly use `aws s3 ls` or the `boto3` python module to traverse through S3 bucket and objects programmatically.

I am writing the summary of our conversation below.  You reached out to AWS Premium Support because you observed that there was a status check failure on your instance ""i-047a28e3978506793"" on 23-11-2020 from 19.05 IST to 20:11 IST and you needed to know the cause.   I inspected the instance and observed the following:  i) The underlying hardware that the instance is on was healthy at the same time frame. ii) The instance had experienced spikes in CPU Utilization [1]. iii) As your instance is a burstable instance, the CPU credits [2] were depleted due to the high CPU utilization.  iv) The disk metrics were okay.   Based on the above observations, I confirmed that this is likely caused by an application running on your system which we Premium Support Engineers do not have insight of as per our Shared Responsibility[3] and Data Privacy [4] models.  You asked if downloading excel sheet and images would cause the issue. I responded that honestly speaking, I wouldn't be sure unless you have a monitoring tool that logged the process activities at the time.   I suggested that you can install free resource monitoring tools like Atop [5] which can log process activities.  It was my pleasure working and assisting you on this case and guiding you to the root cause of the issue.  Please feel free to contact me should you have any further questions, concerns or require any additional assistance regarding this Case, I will be happy to assist you again.

I have mentioned all my investigation here.   As you said, I have also tried to install CloudWatch agent through userdata on an EC2 instance. Thereafter when I tried to check for the CloudWatch agent running inside the instance, I could see that successfully. Also, I could view the metrics getting successfully pushed to CloudWatch. This is why, I could not reproduce the issue. Moving further, I request you to share the AMI of your instance with us, so that I can reprove the issue exactly and troubleshoot further.   I can understand that all this can prove to be a bit tedious task for you. But unfortunately, it is not possible for me to proceed troubleshooting this at my end due to lack of visibility and access to us.  To share the AMI with us, please create a new AMI from current instance (which is facing issue) and then share that AMI with AWS Support account: 155852686413.  Before sharing the AMI with us, please ensure that:           - Root volume of the instance should be attached to instance before creating the AMI.     - Remove any sensitive or confidential data from the AMI and there should not be any malicious programs on that AMI.     - By default, the instance will be rebooted automatically while creating AMI.  Now follow the below steps:       ---------------------     a. In order to create an AMI from your instance :             - Open the Amazon EC2 console.         - Go to ""Instances"" -> Select your instance.         - Select ""Actions"" -> ""Image"" -> ""Create Image"".         - Enter name and description as needed. Do not select ""No-Reboot"" option because the system integrity cannot be checked if a reboot is not done.         - Now this specific AMI will be created and it will be visible in ""AMIs"" in your EC2 Console.      b.

Please find this email as a summary of what we discussed.  You reached out to us as you would like to know the reason for RI utilization displayed for an expired RI.  Upon checking the screenshot attached, we can confirm that RI got expired on 26th November, so it means that the RI was active till 25th November.  So, for this month it will be displayed because utilization is calculated for whole month as it is a contract. Hence, the monthly usages would be shown eventhough if the RI got expired any day in between the month and it should not be displayed from the next month.  However, if you continue seeing this in the next month too, then I request you to reach out to the billing team separately because, I am from EC2 linux team and the billing related queries are handled by our Accounts and Billing team.

I understand the instance  i-0a257d75ffa244c84 was failing instance status checks and you were able to resolve this by performing a Reboot. However even after performing the Reboot the instance is slow, you need us to investigate on this. Please correct me if I am wrong.   I went through the cloudwatch graphs corresponding to  the instance and noticed that there were frequent incidents of status check failures[1]. I checked the system status checks during this interval and confirmed that the instance was passing system level status checks indicating that the instance was residing on a healthy hardware[2]  You may already be aware that the instance status checks failures are caused due to issues within the instance itself. The instance status checks are what monitor OS level health. Below are the reasons due to which the instance status check fail :   - Failed system status checks (system status checks were passing successfully in your case) - Incorrect networking or startup configuration - Exhausted memory (may be the reason) - Corrupted file system - Incompatible kernel  As the instance got Rebooted, I could not get any information from the console level logs ans it gets replaced after Reboot or Stop/start.  I also went through the EBS performance metrics corresponding to the instance and I could find that the Burst balance got depleted at the same time when the instance started failing instance status checks and it started gaining credits 0:11 on 30th November when the I/O operations were stopped[3].  From the metrics, I could see that during the interval the ReadOPs count was approximately 2000 where the limit is 270 (90*3). It went high by using Burst Balance which is why burst balance got depleted during this time. This indicates there was resource pressure in terms of EBS volume on the instance.

To recap our conversation, you reached out because your were facing an issue with changing UUID of a volume. The UUID reverts to the previous one after mounting the file system.  We ran a dmesg on the instance and noticed the error 'group descriptors corrupted' in the output. We then ran a file system repair by running the command below   $ fsck.ext4 <device-path>  We then performed the same steps again and confirmed that the UUID persisted even after mounting.  As agreed on chat, I will close this case for you .  I hope you find this summary of the case helpful. If you have any other questions in this regard, kindly reach back to us and we will be happy to assist.  Thank you and have a great day ahead  We value your feedback.

I have received update form our internal services team and they have shared more details provided below.  Monthly updates occur in two modes ""Security-Only updates"" and ""Monthly Rollups”.  Security-Only updates will be published only to Windows Server Update Services (WSUS), where it can be consumed by other tools like ConfigMgr, and the Windows Update Catalog, where it can be downloaded for use with other tools or processes. You won’t see this package offered to PCs that are directly connected to Windows Update. Windows Update will only receive ""Monthly Rollups"" not ""Security-Only updates”.  This is an expected behaviour and explained in the following article.   https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/windows-blog-archive/more-on-windows-7-and-windows-8-1-servicing-changes/ba-p/166783  As suggested previously, the best way to configure patching would be to go with WSUS configuration. You can configure single or multiple WSUS servers and they need not be joined to the domain. Instead the WSUS server can act as a standalone server and all your different domain members should be able to talk to your WSUS server.  Also I would like to share that this kind of scenario does not come directly under escalation for Microsoft support. Please refer to the public document here [1] to know more about support agreement between AWS and Microsoft that cover support issues.  I hope the information to be useful.

Please find a brief summary of our discussion below:  You reached out to us you were using spinnaker to launch instances and it was unable to connect to the instance via SSH and hence was terminating instances. I checked that both your worker nodes had public IP and were using internet gateway. However, in the security group attached to the new instances you had allowed traffic from private IPs of the worker node's VPC. Hence, I requested you to allow public IPs of both the worker nodes in security group and then spinnaker was able to establish ssh connection. But after that it terminated instance due to wrong user name. I asked you to use ""ubuntu"" instead of centos. Then we got error ""mv: cannot move ‘/tmp/spinnaker-0.repo’ to ‘/etc/yum.repos.d/’: Not a directory"". I informed you that there is no ‘/etc/yum.repos.d/ in the instances launched from ami-0bb8408b37500e3be. Further you mentioned that you will be checking configuration from your end.  Further, as discussed, I would be marking this case as resolved and in case you have any other concerns, you can always reach out to us via a new support case and we would be more than glad to assist you.

While AWS takes care of the vulnerabilities at the infrastructure level. We also update our AMIs with the latest patch updates on a monthly basis to ensure the instances launched from such AMI have patches released to remedy such vulnerabilities. However please keep in mind that customer also have to make sure Operating Systems are regularly patch for instance launched from previous AMI as the Shared Responsibility Model [2].  Furthermore, if these are security vulnerabilities being detected for EC2 instances, I would highly recommend that you take a look at Amazon Inspector [3].

Because R5 instances are built on the latest generation Nitro system [1], there are several steps which should be performed before you change the instance type to R5, these are listed in the reference document [2]. I understand that the instance is a custom AMI launched over two years ago running Windows Server 2012 R2, and based off this information the following parts will need to be completed on the current instance:  Part 1: Installing and upgrading AWS PV drivers [3] Part 2: Installing and upgrading ENA [4] Part 3: Upgrading AWS NVMe drivers [5] Part 4: Updating EC2Config and EC2Launch [6] Part 6: Updating power management settings [7]  We confirmed on our call that many of these components are using an older version or do not currently exist on the source instance. Each of the links provides steps for both downloading and installation. Once each of the parts above have been completed you can change the instance type to r5, this process does not change any data on the operating system. While not mandatory, I would also recommend taking a snapshot of the EBS volumes [8] before making any system changes.  If you do have any other queries about the process for changing the instance type, feel free to reach out at any time and I would be happy to assist.

Please find below a short summary of our chat.  You wished to know how to move from IMDSv1 to IMDSv2.   I was able to clarify that by default all EC2 instances support usage of IMDSv1 and v2 as they are 2 different services running on the Hypervisor level and can co-exist. It would only be how the EC2 instance is communicating with meta-data service and will get chosen automatically.   With IMDSv2 you could require an HTTP token whereas with IMDSv1 there’s no such requirement. I suggested going through the links below for a guide through transitioning from v1 to v2.

My name is Soumya and I will be assisting you with the case today.  Problem Description ======================== From your case correspondence, I understand that you would like to know why the instance: i-098a9732b2a9c79ab  was in stopped state since the last three days. Please correct me if I misunderstood your query.  Issue Cause ======================== On checking the instance details, I can see that the we had detected the degradation of the underlying hardware, on which the instance was hosted on before it was stopped. Hence, a scheduled retirement for maintenance was arranged to take place 2020-12-11 04:00:00 UTC. An email was also sent to the registered email ID informing the same and could also been seen in PHD. This is the reason that the instance was stopped for the last three days.

I have also checked the other parameters related with the instance and they are also fine. I can totally understand the inconvenience this would have caused you. Please accept our sincerest apologies.  Suggestion ========================  I want to assure you that we make every commercially available effort to make sure Amazon Web Services is secure and resilient to provide you high reliability and massive scale. However, hardware and network failures do inevitably occur in every environment. We try our best to restrict the downtime caused by such failures to be very brief.  You may also want to take this opportunity to re-examine your AWS architecture to look for possible ways to make it even more fault-tolerant.

We want you to be aware that on November 30, 2020 all Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6-based products transitioned from the Maintenance Phase to the Extended Life Phase [1]. For customers running Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 on-demand instances on Amazon EC2, a standard server subscription is included and cannot be extended to include the extended lifecycle support or other add-on subscriptions. The standard subscription provided for all on-demand instances entitles AWS customers to continue to run any release version of RHEL, but for customers who require the benefits provided by Red Hat's Extended Lifecycle Support add-on additional steps to convert the instance will be required.  For your convenience, we are providing an official Red Hat AMI with the ELS add-on [2] listed on the AWS Marketplace [3] for purchase as of December 01, 2020. Please refer to Red Hat's RHEL 6 ELS information page [4] for more details on the product offering. Customers using Red Hat on-demand subscriptions will need to migrate to this new AMI to receive ELS benefits Alternatively, it is possible to contact Red Hat directly to address strategies for moving workloads from on-demand, hourly subscriptions to annual subscriptions including RHEL 6 with ELS, Customers may migrate their running instances from on-demand to cloud-access and procure annual subscriptions for RHEL 6.10 with ELS directly from Red Hat. If you need to review alternative options or further assistance in your instance migration, please work with your AWS account team and AWS Premium Support [5] to engage the Red Hat Partner team for additional information.

However you would like to know the reason for the status checks failure and suggestion to overcome such issue in future.  Using our internal tools, I quickly reviewed your instance “i-0620841e8d928445d” and found that the instance was running on a degraded hardware due to which instance failed both the status checks at around 2020-12-14 23:14 UTC. Please refer cloudwatch metrics [1] and [2] to review status checks at your end. After you performed stop/start at around 2020-12-15 00:01 UTC, your instance was successfully moved to another underlying host. Currently I can see your instance is running on a healthy host and hence passing both the status checks.  Furthermore I would like to inform you that we have automated systems in place which constantly monitors the health of the underlying hosts and whenever it identifies a potential issue with the host, we pro-actively send out retirement notifications to our customers, in order to prevent downtime. Hence, in your case as well, I could see this degradation on the underlying hardware, hosting your instance, was already detected by our automated systems and therefore hardware was scheduled for retirement. We (AWS) has also published a notification regarding this scheduled event in your Personal Health Dashboard prior to the scheduled retirement date.  You can check the details about this retirement event in your Personal Health Dashboard (PHD) with an Event name - ""EC2 persistent instance retirement scheduled"".

7757083651,Amagi Media Labs Private Limited,Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2 - Linux),APAC,INDIA,moegalli,"Hello, Allie here from the AWS Cape Town team.  I have worked through all of the logs and metrics available to me, but could not find a reason for why the CPU utilization of instance i-048f4049fcc232def spiked and the instance started failing its instance health checks.  I can see where the instance level health checks [1] started failing at 2020/12/18 00:51 UTC [2]. But I did not find any issues with the underlying hardware serving the instance before the stop/start. Besides the 100% CPU utilization [3], I also checked the other instance metrics available to me (Network and Storage), and also did know find any utilization that would have caused an issue. I also worked through the instance system log [4], but once again did not see any reason for the unresponsiveness.  As AWS support engineers do not have access to the inner workings of customer resources, I would like to ask that you check the operating system logs for any sign of what could have happened. I regularly use these commands while troubleshooting such issues:    dmesg | grep -e ""error\|fail\|fatal\|panic\|trace""   sudo grep -e ""error\|fail\|fatal\|panic\|trace"" /var/log/messages  Additionally, because high CPU utilization looks to be related to the issue, a tool like atop[5] that logs what process is utilizing resources can help find what was causing the issue. Finally, if you find another instance that is unresponsive, consider checking the screenshot [6] from it before stop/starting. I find this very often has useful information.  I trust that this information is helps, but please let me know if there is any more assistance that I can offer.

As discussed I am sending you a summary email.  We got on call and screenshare and checked the event viewer logs for instance i-062724e820ad98f56, under system logs we could see errors and warning starting around 12 noon on 18th December. In the errors we can see that DNSClient service was crashing, Kerberos(KDC) service was unable to recognize the computer objects and the machine was running low on memory with following errors ""Windows successfully diagnosed a low virtual memory condition."" ""The server was unable to allocate from the system nonpaged pool because the pool was empty""  From the Cloudwatch logs on our end we can see that instance failed instance health check around 3:30 PM but from the OS logs we can see the instance was facing the issue much before that. As stated in my previous email the instance's outgoing packet count had already dropped after 2PM IST but still the OS was up and running on low memory. Instance status checks monitor the software and network configuration of your individual instance. Amazon EC2 checks the health of the instance by sending an address resolution protocol (ARP) request to the network interface (NIC). https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/monitoring-system-instance-status-check.html#instance-status-checks  So it seems till 3:30 PM the OS was responding to AWS hardware but after that it possibly crashed due to low memory or due to low memory it was unable to respond to AWS's address resolution protocol (ARP) requests.  Please note, by default Cloudwatch does not monitor the memory consumption, we have to enable that manually and as discussed on call you mentioned that you have enabled memory monitoring now.  Also when it comes to domain controllers it is suggested to run on minimum 16GB memory by Microsoft and as we know it was running earlier on T3.medium which had 4GB memory.

Considering the privacy of AWS customers data, we are not supposed to share these details to another customer. And that is why reaching out to the AWS Abuse team was the best way to go about this.  I worked with the Abuse team on the issue and also confirmed that you submit the request to abuse team directly via the contact form. Once this was done, I also got in touch with the team via internal ticket for thorough investigation for which your Technical Account Manager has access to as well  They have confirmed that they are working on it and the actions would be taken for the culprit AWS account involved in the abuse and they may block the account resources and access accordingly. Since the Abuse activities are handled by the Abuse team directly, I would request you to please wait for an update from them with the necessary details. They will reach out as soon as possible and the ETA should not be more than 24 hours.  Lastly, I would like to inform you that AWS takes the security and privacy of its customers very seriously, due to which, such issues of security and abuse are handled directly by our abuse team. We, here at AWS Support, do not have any access or visibility to such issues since the abuse team works out of a completely different queue than us.

My name is Stephen and I will be assisting you with this case. I understand you enabled IMDSv2 on instance i-01bc30b56e23738a6 and afterwards started seeing 503 errors.   As you may already know, enabling the IMDSv2 adds another layer of security to access the instance metadata. The queries to the metadata endpoint will require a valid session token, with limited operation time. Please refer to [1]. From the attachments you have shared I am unable to confirm if you are passing the token as needed.   In addition the latest versions of the AWS SDKs and CLIs support IMDSv2. To use IMDSv2, make sure that your EC2 instances have the latest versions of the AWS SDKs and CLIs. Please refer to [2].  As an example, let's say that, with IMDSv1, you used to get the instance ID with the following curl command:  curl http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/instance-id  After enabling IMDSv2, the request above will no longer work:  curl -vv http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/instance-id  *   Trying 169.254.169.254... * TCP_NODELAY set * Connected to 169.254.169.254 (169.254.169.254) port 80 (#0) > GET /latest/meta-data/instance-id HTTP/1.1 > Host: 169.254.169.254 > User-Agent: curl/7.61.1 > Accept: */* >  < HTTP/1.1 401 Unauthorized < Content-Length: 0 < Date: Wed, 09 Sep 2020 14:50:12 GMT < Server: EC2ws < Connection: close < Content-Type: text/plain <  * Closing connection 0   You will need to submit the request with a valid token, which you can get with the following PUT request:  $ curl -X PUT ""http://169.254.169.254/latest/api/token"" -H ""X-aws-ec2-metadata-token-ttl-seconds: 21600"" AQAExxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxgSKz31_bP3EQucCR01r-q-Q==   As you can see, I requested a token with a limited lifetime of 21600 seconds (6 hours), which is the maximum allowed.

I am Sunny and it was my pleasure to assist you on chat today. Below I am posting a short summary of our chat.  From the case notes I understood that you would like to know about the sixth generation Instances launched by Amazon.  Amazon has launched three new Six generation instances powered by AWS-designed, Arm-based Graviton2 processors. The new general purpose (M6g), compute-optimized (C6g), and memory-optimized (R6g) instances deliver up to 40% better price/performance over comparable current generation x86-based instances. These sixth generation Amazon EC2 instances include:      M6g instances: designed for general-purpose workloads with balanced compute, memory, and networking, such as application servers, mid-size databases, microservices, and caching fleets.      C6g instances: designed for compute-intensive workloads, such as high performance computing, batch processing, video encoding, gaming, scientific modeling, distributed analytics, ad-serving, and CPU-based machine learning inference.      R6g instances: designed for workloads that process large data sets in memory, such as open source databases (MySQL, MariaDB, and PostgreSQL) or in-memory caches (Redis, Memcached, and KeyDB), and real-time big data analytics.  For more details about the new graviton processor Instances, please refer the document :   ----------------------------------------------------------- https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/graviton/ https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/m6/ -----------------------------------------------------------  Also all these new Instance types are currently available in Singapore and Mumbai region and you were able to verify the same.  I hope the above Information helps. Please feel free to write back to us if you have any further queries. It would be my pleasure to assist you.  Stay safe and have a great day!

You can see a summary of our conversation below.  You reached out to AWS as you experienced an issue with your instance i-0aad2a47c2ece27b3 going down and required assistance getting it back online.  As discussed on our chat session, your instance was running on underlying hardware that was experiencing issues. Because of this, it was required that you perform a stop/start to move the instance to new and healthy underlying hardware.  After you had performed the stop/start on the instance, the instance started passing health checks and you were able to connect to it successfully.  On behalf of AWS, I sincerely apologize for any inconvenience that this has caused for you.  AWS makes great effort to make sure these types of situations occur as infrequently as possible, however, these type of failures can and do occur. For this reason, we also highly encourage our customers to adopt redundancy and high availability if they seek to further minimize any potential downtime or issues. This includes setting up CloudWatch alarms to help mitigate any downtime experienced [1].  For future reference, when there are issues with the underlying hardware, a normal stop may not work. If the instance does get stuck when you perform a stop, please perform a force stop on the instance. You can force stop an instance using either the console or the AWS CLI [2].   a. To force the instance to stop using the console, select the stuck instance, and choose Actions, Instance State, Stop, and Yes, Forcefully Stop.   b. To force the instance to stop using the AWS CLI, use the stop-instances command and the --force option as follows:      aws ec2 stop-instances --instance-ids <instance-id>  --force  [1] Create Alarms That Stop, Terminate, Reboot, or Recover an Instance:  https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/UsingAlarmActions.html [2] Troubleshooting Stopping Your Instance: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/TroubleshootingI","Jan 4, 2021",RE:[CASE 7820391221] Chat: Status check failed for prod-acppr-notif-mongo-1,"January 4, 2021 10:36:24",2,nikheel conversation assistance hardware underlying hardware health behalf inconvenience effort situation redundancy availability downtime watch alarm downtime reference hardware stop force stop cli stop cli option create alarm terminate reboot

7855195571,Ibibo Group,Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2 - Linux),APAC,INDIA,bbhavini,"Hello,  I am Bhavini from AWS Premium Support. I hope this email finds you well!   It was a pleasure having a conversation with you today. This email is a summary of our conversation over chat and screenshare session.  You reached out to us as you were facing issues with disk configurations at the OS level.   While on screenshare we could see that you were facing issues on your instance 'i-00ac3598c8c199b5e' similarly with 3 other instances which were launched from your terraform platform.   On screenshare, we could see that you were able to see the volume in your lsblk output however were unable to see the same in df -h output. Moving forward, you mounted the disk on /data mount point however it was still not showing. We went ahead and checked the /etc/fstab entries and could see that the mount point was being previously used by disk /dev/xvdb which was present in your earlier instance type.   As explained on screenshare that due to this as the mount point is already being used the disk /dev/nvme1n1 was not getting mounted on the same point. To confirm the same we went ahead and created a new mount point, it can be any location you want:   $ sudo mkdir /db  After creating the mount point, we then ran the command to mount the disk. Mount command automatically detects the file system on disk.

Here is the short recap of the issue.  Over the call you have explained us about there could be a latency between these two instances spread across different AZ which was some issues in your application.  i-0e4cc562367ef84a5 (TUL_PRODUCTION-02) receiver  -  ap-south-1b i-0e191e4eda73084bd (TUL_PRODUCTION-01) sender -  ap-south-1a  On the call we have tried to see how your application behaves for an example. During the testing i saw the CloudWatch metrics. Both the side i saw speed ~ 10G.  Using internal tools i also confirm that there were no packet drops or no inter AZ latency seen between these two AZs.  To assist you further, i tried launch two instances one in ap-south-1a and ap-south-1b.   The use case was mirroring the data between these two instance (which i believe some sort of copy). So, i have checked the network bandwidth using ""iperf3"" on both the instances. Installed ""iperf3"" on both the instances.   Server is on ap-south-1b. Started the iperf3 in Server mode by running the below $ sudo iperf3 -s -p 5001   Client is on ap-south-1a. Started the iper3 in the client mode by running the below $  sudo iperf3 -c 172.31.6.46  -p 5001 -P5  ...

This confirms that there is no latency between different AZs.  So, in your case as well, if you could try the similar on the two server nodes to rule out any network issues.  Please run the above commands on the two server nodes TUL_PRODUCTION-01 and TUL_PRODUCTION-02 to check the network issues.  Also,  please let me know what will the mirroring do in the backend so that i can also try the same to replicate the issue from AWS end.

My name is Deepak and I'm pleased to have you on screen. Here is the recap of our conversation.  You reached out as one of your Instance is i-06983d10fcba71498 consistently using the high CPU resources and you are also getting the System process as contributing the 50-60 % of your utilization and you need assistance to remediate the issue.  AWS Premium support does not have visibility inside the Instance OS or installed application due to customer Data Privacy [1] and shared responsibility model [2]. Third Party application is out of scope for AWS premium support [3].  You observed that Ntoskrnl.exe along with Window NT system process is taking half of your CPU resources and you need the AWS recommendation on that as well.  This can be owed to the ntoskrnl.exe memory handler. Ntoskrnl.exe (Short for Windows NT operating system kernel) otherwise known as kernel image, is a system application file that provides the kernel and executive layers of the Windows NT kernel space, and is responsible for various system services such as hardware virtualization, process and memory management, thus making it a fundamental part of the system. It contains the cache manager, the executive, the kernel, the security reference monitor, the memory manager, and the scheduler.  That is why Ntoskrnl.exe is such a protected system file.   Ntoskrnl.exe is a well-protected system file that hardly crushes or gets corrupt. However, if it does get corrupt, ntoskrnl.exe will malfunction and not know what and when to write into the RAM or what and when to free the RAM space. This might lead to piling up of data and memory pages leaving the CPU working extra hard to manage this memory space.   You also mentioned that you have created the Instance with same AMI and you are not facing the issue with a different Instance as mentioned this functioning of system file and In Memory content is different for a Operating system also it can be issue with file system, outdated drives and Windows Security updates","Jan 18, 2021",RE:[CASE 7879913151] Call: CPU credit details  on this instance id ( i-06983d10fcba71498),"January 18, 2021 15:01:34",5,screen recap conversation resource utilization visibility o privacy responsibility model party scope exe nt half resource recommendation memory handler kernel image kernel executive layer kernel space hardware virtualization memory cache manager executive kernel reference monitor memory manager scheduler exe exe ntoskrnl exe ram ram space memory page memory space functioning memory content operating drive update

I reviewed the instances from my end and saw that they were in stopped state and you also confirmed that they stopped after around 15 minutes. You then started and the instances and they went into running state successfully. You asked why did they take a long time to stop, to which I informed you that the instances had not been stopped for a long time (2 years) and while there is no specified frequency for performing stop start, it is generally recommended to ensure that your instances are running on a healthy hardware.

Please find the summary of our chat below. You contacted us as you were unable to increase the size of the partition /dev/xvda2 using growpart command.  While we were on screenshare we could recreate the error.  I checked it Internally with the team and informed you that if there are multiple partitions on the EBS volume, we will be able to change the size of only the last partition.   I requested you to perform a re-partitioning or to use new partition and transfer all data from old partition to this one.   As discussed I am marking the case as resolved.

Thank you for your time over the chat today, it was a pleasure assisting you.  Unfortunately our chat got disconnected before we could complete our troubleshooting session. That being said, I have shared my analysis on the issue below.  You reached out as you are facing an intermittent issue of 1/2 status checks failing corresponding to the instance ""i-009f42290222994f4"" every 8-9 days after which the instance comes back up when you perform a stop-start on the instance. You would like for a permanent resolution on the same. Kindly correct me if I misunderstood your query.

7943437891,HDFC Life Insurance Company Limited,Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2 - Linux),APAC,INDIA,isiaho,"Good day Parshuram,  Harun here from AWS Premium Support. It was a pleasure chatting with you today.  To recap our conversation. you reached out to us because you  were unable to access the EC2 instance 'i-07ad56c28b0bc352a' from your Citrix machine. Connectivity to other EC2 instances on the same network was working except for this instance.  We reviewed and flushed the firewall rules but this did not help either. We then noticed that docker had been installed on the EC2 instance and a docker network '172.26.0.0/16' had been created which was conflicting with the IP of the Citrix server '172.26.58.100'. This was leading to an asymmetric routing issue.  To address the issue, we uninstalled docker service and deleted the route as below   -----------------------------------------------   $ ip route del 172.26.0.0/16   -----------------------------------------------  After deleting the route, we confirmed connectivity to be working.  As agreed on chat, I will mark this case as resolved since no further action is required from our end.  I hope you find this summary of the case helpful. If you have any other questions in this regard, kindly reach back to us and we will be happy to assist.  Thank you and have a great day ahead  We value your feedback.

Here is a brief summary fo the discussion that we had so far.  You were getting the error because the environment variables, that you fetch after SSO user portal login for the permission assigned to you has expired.  You can increase the session duration to control the length of time that a user can be signed in to an AWS account. When the specified duration has elapsed, AWS signs the user out of the session.  Refer :https://docs.aws.amazon.com/singlesignon/latest/userguide/howtosessionduration.html   On call as discussed The AWS CLI stores this information in a profile (a collection of settings) named default in the credentials file. By default, the information in this profile is used when you run an AWS CLI command that doesn't explicitly specify a profile to use.  However setting the environment variable changes the value used until the end of your shell session, or until you set the variable to a different value. You can make the variables persistent across future sessions by setting them in your shell's startup script.  The AWS CLI uses credentials and configuration settings located in multiple places, such as the system or user environment variables, local AWS configuration files, or explicitly declared on the command line as a parameter. Certain locations take precedence over others. The AWS CLI credentials and configuration settings take precedence in the following order:  1.Command line options – Overrides settings in any other location. You can specify --region, --output, and --profile as parameters on the command line.  2.Environment variables – You can store values in your system's environment variables.  3.CLI credentials file – The credentials and config file are updated when you run the command aws configure. The credentials file is located at ~/.aws/credentials on Linux or macOS, or at C:\Users\USERNAME\.aws\credentials on Windows. This file can contain the credential details for the default profile and any named profiles.  4.CLI config","Feb 3, 2021",RE:[CASE 7948781361] Chat: Configure AWS CLI to use SSO,"February 3, 2021 10:09:26",4,fo discussion environment variable portal login permission duration length duration sign refer cli store profile default credential default profile cli profile environment shell variable shell cli credential setting place environment variable line parameter location precedence others cli credential setting precedence order line option setting location parameter line environment variable environment variable cli credential credential config credential o c credential default profile profile cli config

It was a pleasure having a conversation with you today. This email is a summary of our conversation over chat and screenshare session.  You reached out to us as you were facing issues with port 9000 on your instance 'i-043fa141f38faf4a5'   While on chat I could see that the instance is in a private subnet, and port 9000 is open in the security group. Further I could see that there were deny rules for certain CIDR ranges in your NACLs thus I had asked you to confirm from where you are trying to telnet on this port. You had informed that you were trying from the server itself.   Thus we jumped on a screenshare, and I could see that when you tried to telnet from the server you were getting connection refused. As explained on chat, ""Connection refused"" means that the port you are trying to connect to is not actually open. Either you are connecting to the wrong IP address, or to the wrong port, or the server is listening on the wrong port, or is not actually running. Thus to delve deeper, I had asked you to check if any service is listening on this port and I could see from the netstat output that no service was listening on port 9000 as the following command returned no output :   netstat -tulpn | grep :9000  Further we did a port scan using nmap by running the following command and could see that the port 9000 was closed :   nmap -Pn -p 9000 10.45.249.105  From the above we could see that the nmap returned a port closed on the 9000. Nmap returns a port closed means that a closed port is accessible (it receives and responds to Nmap probe packets), but there is no application listening on it. They can be helpful in showing that a host is up on an IP address (host discovery, or ping scanning), and as part of OS detection. Closed ports have no application listening on them, though they could open up at any time.  Thus you were unable to telnet and were getting connection refused as the port being open from the security groups however no ","Feb 4, 2021",RE:[CASE 7953893791] Chat: port not working,"February 4, 2021 12:32:05",4,bhavini email conversation email conversation screenshare subnet deny rule cidr nacls screenshare mean deeper netstat output output nmap mean host o detection

You can see the commands below:   $ sudo apt-get update -y  $ sudo apt-get upgrade  When I received the prompt regarding the '/etc/sudoers' configuration file, I selected the default option to keep the current version. After this, I once again ran the script in [1] and observed no errors this time. I had then changed the instance type to a t3.micro and successfully connected to the instance.

It was a pleasure to chat with you on the call today, below is a recap of our conversation.  You reached out to AWS Premium Support as you wanted to know from which instance was the request '/tsa_api/copy_fares_of_version2' made to your application. You have an application which consists of 10 instances which are behind an ELB and Auto Scaling group, those instances connect via a gateway to another application and would like to know which of those 10 instances made the above request to the second application. From the logs you can see the IP of the gateway but not the IP of the instance. I advised you to try to make your application to log a more verbose entry for the request if this is possible. As I do not have visibility on your application/instances nor I know how it was designed, I would advise you to engage your internal team for further assistance.  Further, if you have VPC flow logs enabled for your VPC you may be able to track the request made to the application by checking those. You can read more on how to enable from [1]. To view VPC flow logs please follow the steps shown in [2].  If you have further questions regarding VPC flow logs do not hesitate to reach out to our Networking team and they they will be more than happy to assist you.  As agreed, I will mark this support case as resolved for now. Always feel free to reach out to us and raise a new case if you face any issue. We will be more than happy to help.

Question : Could you please confirm NESTED Virtualization is supported on EC2 instances?  As of this writing, nested virtualization on standard EC2 instances are not supported however, using Bare metal instance type you can launch Virtualization software like Hyper-V or install Linux to configure container services. Bare metal instances [1] provide your applications with direct access to the processor and memory resources of the underlying server.  I have shared a blog article [2] showing the steps to configure Hyper-V on Amazon EC2 Bare Metal Instances. After configuring Hyper-V, I understand that Docker [3] can be installed and configured directly on the server.  I have also shared the link for Amazon Elastic Container services [4], which is a fully managed service but I am not sure the service is suitable for your requirements so check out the information provided for the service.

Please find a brief summary of our discussion below:  You reached out to us as you wanted to launch an instance from a deregistered AMI. I informed you that you cannot launch an instance from a deregistered AMI. Further, you mentioned that you have around 1300 snapshots in Singapore region and you want to delete the old snapshots but don't want to deregister the AMIs because in that case, auto scaling will fail to start a new instance.  I explained you that when you create an AMI, its corresponding snapshots are created at the backend and to delete such snapshots you need to deregister the AMI first. However, you should be able to delete the snapshots which are explicitly created from a volume. You added that you will segregate snapshots which are corresponding to AMIs using aws-cli.

Our chat was prematurely terminated before I could provide you with more information. However I can confirm that I have the information that you requested.  During our chat I spent time researching a possible reason as to why the Gravitron instance types were unavailable, and I believed it be the fact that they were not populating due to the AMI in the launch configuration/template for your spot requests.   Afterward you had questions regarding the spot-interruption rates for ap-south-1 (Mumbai) I tried to determine this from my side however there was/is no data for these instance types, the Spot Instance interruption rate data is based on the Frequency of interruption represents the rate at which Spot has reclaimed capacity during the trailing month. They are in ranges of < 5%, 5-10%,10-15%,15-20% and >20%.   In this case, if instances are not in the table it means there is no data on spot instance interruptions for a given region, I checked for other regions (af-south-1, Cape Town and eu-south-1, Milan) and I see that some Gravitron instance family types do not reflect here either along with other instance types, so here we see its not specific to the instance type but rather the data required to generate interruption rates, the values of these rates depend on the usage/launches of spot instances over time i a particular region.   I do however thank you for allowing me to look into this for you, and allowing you to answer your question.   If you have any additional followup questions on this matter then please feel free to revert back to me.

7994030871,Tata Communications Ltd.,Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2 - Linux),APAC,INDIA,leonjosh,"Hello,  I understand that you are observing a high load at 1am every day and are querying what the cause may be.  If you could please confirm the time zone you are using for the time 1am - I'm presuming it is IST which would be about 19:30 UTC.   To confirm I am seeing increased CPU utilization during the period around 19:30 UTC each day however the CPU increases [1] from around 1% to maximum of 8% during these spikes. Reviewing the EBS Volume vol-014148e47d4c4ecae I am not seeing any indication of a throttle or latency spike seen over the last 5 days.  Further there does not seem to be a correlation between the slight usage spikes and the NetworkIn [2] and NetworkOut [3] metrics. The underlying Hardware running the instance is healthy and is not seeing latency spikes or packet loss.  In order to investigate this further I can suggest three possible routes, the first is to configure and enable the Cloudwatch agent on the instance in order to add Memory metrics for this instance to Cloudwatch. Although the CPU spike is slight the memory might be larger and I do not have visibility on that metric you can use the steps here to install this [4]. You can then use the steps here [5] to configure the cloudwatch agent wizard.  Another option would to be to install sar [6] or atop [7] which are both resource monitoring and logging programs which will store in /var/log the usage of aspects such as network, cpu, memory,disk and applications running in the case of atop. This will further help identify the cause of the spike and when exactly it is triggered.  The final option is to review the instance logs and create an sos report [8] (please note that I am unable to determine the distribution the ami is named cloudendure_image_2020-06-17_10-02-15_2d9bf95c30b39193 and the console logs do not show which distribution the instance is,  sos reports installation methods vary across distributions and I'd be happy to provide exact steps once I know which on the instance is.)

Upon further testing and investigating, I found out that when you copy from WMware data repository, it expected to fail because you copied the vmdk file, skipping the export. The file will contains invalid configuration which we are not able to read.  To use your VM in Amazon EC2, you must first export it from the virtualization environment, and then import it into Amazon EC2 as either an Amazon Machine Image (AMI) or an instance. You can do that by import VMDK files into Amazon EC2 that were created through the OVF export process in VMware[1]  You need to do the following when creating the VMDK image.  1. You must first export as OVF   2. Then  you can get VMDKs from that OVF  3. Please try the import again.  If there is anything that is unclear or you need clarity on, please feel free to reach out.

""Untagged resources or tags that aren't defined in the tag policy aren't evaluated for compliance with the tag policy.""  I then suggested that you use the star wildcard ""*"" to match all ""Name"" values, when you asked how to overcome this - because a name can be anything. I have confirmed in the documentation [2]: ""You can use the * wildcard in tag values and enforced_for fields. You can use only one wildcard per tag value.

It was a pleasure to assist you on the chat/call and screenshare session. Please find a summary below.   You reached out to us as you wanted to know why creating a new version of the launch template was giving a different AMI ID when only the userdata was modified.   During the screenshare session, we checked the launch template lt-0a9c23473a077bfc2 and were able to see that there were multiple versions for the same launch template. We tried to create a new version of the launch template and were able to see that the console inherits/auto-fills the properties of the parent version. Due to the nature of the API calls we are unable to confirm the parent of the Launch template version 11 and hence unable to conclude about the same. Since we are able to see this behavior and can see that version 11 uses the same version as the version 2, it seems to be the only possibility. As requested by you I have reached out to our internal team with a feature request to consider checking for the validity of the AMI ID while creating the launch template version. Due to the vast scale of our services, it may take a while before we have any updates about the possibility of implementing this feature. Thank you for understanding.   You also had an additional query regarding deletion of the AMIs and snapshots used in the AMIs. As demonstrated, deleting a snapshot that is being used by the AMI is not possible and the only option is to deregister the AMI.   In your autoscaling group, you have noticed that when the AMI used by the launch template is deregistered, you have got two kinds of errors   - .InvalidSnapshot.NotFound  - InvalidAMIID.NotFound  As mentioned over the call, I am not aware of the exact reason for the difference in the error messages in this scenario. I will be working internally to find the exact cause of this difference and get back to you once I have more details.

You reached out as you were having issues with your instance ""i-07aa006dbca33ce40"" which Starts but suddenly goes to Stop state with an error ""Client.InstanceInitiatedShutdown""  Upon doing a thorough research and investigation on this issue, I was able to narrow this issue to an action being triggered from the OS of the instance. In particular, the ""Client.InstanceInitiatedShutdown"" occurs when there is a $shutdown -h commands that is triggered from the OS of this instance.  Please note, as AWS engineers we do not have access to the OS level of your instances due to strict security constraints, so I am therefore unable to see what or who exactly runs this $shutdown -h inside the instance. However, as a way to mitigate and find the root cause of this issue, we need to have  access to the OS level of this instance to be able to see what triggers the $shutdown -h command. To do this, you would have to    1. Detach the root volume of the instance ""i-07aa006dbca33ce40"" and attach it to another instance test instance as secondary volume.   2. Mount the volume to be able to have access to its OS shell.   3. Execute the following to check what triggers the shutdowm i.e     3.1.  Please check which Target is the default target in your instance. It could be that the default target on th instance is set to 0     $ systemctl get-default     $ systemctl set-default graphical.target    3.2 You can execute the following commands to display the list of last reboots/shutdowns.

What is the expanded support agreement between Amazon and Microsoft, and how does it benefit me?  For customers that have purchased AWS Support at the Business or Enterprise tier, AWS Support is able to work directly with Microsoft support engineers to resolve issues related to customers running Microsoft Windows Server, SQL Server, or Windows desktop (via Amazon Workspaces) on AWS. As a result of this expanded support agreement, AWS can engage directly with Microsoft to create the best possible support experience. If necessary, AWS Support can escalate issues directly to Microsoft and work with dedicated Microsoft support engineers to help ensure issues are addressed and resolved.     Can AWS open a support case with Microsoft on issues I might encounter?

I am sending you a recap of what we discussed.  You had opened a call as you had an issue with Latency across multiple instances and accounts today in the AP-South-1 region. Your monitoring system threw up a number of alerts at this time to notify you of this.  As discussed on the call, AWS had some issues in this region today. At approximately 2PM IST today, we experienced connectivity issues between two availability zones in the AP-SOUTH-1 Region. At this time we also experienced increased API error rates and latencies in the AP-SOUTH-1 Region. This issue has now been resolved and the service is operating normally.  On behalf of AWS, I apologize for any inconvenience caused by this failure. I hope you can understand that from time to time we may encounter issues, we try to minimize the effect but sometimes our customers may experience issues with it. When system issues of this nature occur, our dedicated Infrastructure teams thoroughly investigate the cause and architect system improvements. The details of this process are kept highly confidential in order to protect our AWS platform and customers. Although we cannot share specifics on the root cause of the failure, I can assure you we are taking every possible measure to mitigate such issues in future.   I hope this information is helpful. We apologize for any inconvenience this issue has caused to you, if you have any additional questions or queries, please do not hesitate to contact me.  Have a great day!  We value your feedback.

From your correspondence, I understand that you have instance failing status checks, and you are unable to determine why this is the case.  The instances in question are:  ================== i-0f9fa526b8c5a8858 i-02496180c0455bdb1 ==================  You have mentioned that these instances are shutdown on a nightly basis.  After reviewing instance: i-0f9fa526b8c5a8858, I have not been able to find any recent status check failures. I have however found that there are periods where the status check metric is not recorded. This however does fit in with the description you have provided of shutting down the instances every night. You can view the same information at the CloudWatch links here[1,2].  I then reviewed instance: i-02496180c0455bdb1. On this instance, I can clearly see that it has previously failed status checks, and is currently failing the instance level status checks. The same can be seen at the CloudWatch links here[3,4]. After reviewing the console logs for the instance, I have found that the instance is running out of disk space on the root volume. This is confirmed by the error message produced:  ================== OSError: [Errno 28] No space left on device ==================  In order to resolve this issue, the volume in question would need to be resized in order to extend the partition on the volume. To do this, I have included a link here[5], which will walk you through the process step by step. Once you have increased the volume size, you would need to extend the filesystem on the volume, this can be done by following the steps provided here[6]. Once completed, the error will disappear and the status check will pass again. It is important to understand that services require disk space in order to run, seeing as when a service is started, this information is logged. If there is no disk space to log information about a service, the service will fail to start and can lead to status check fail","Feb 22, 2021",RE:[CASE 8021723621] frequent system check fail,"February 22, 2021 13:17:04",3,query failing basis period description night cloud watch cloud watch space errno space device order order partion size filesystem space order disk space fail

To summarize our discussion on the session : You were unable to connect to the instance via Session Manager.   The instances were in a private subnet and thus, I mentioned that we would need to create VPC endpoints[1] so that instances can connect to SSM and we can then access them via Session Manager. Once we created the endpoints and configured the relevant security group with subnet CIDR of the subnet to which instances belonged, you were able to access them via Session Manager.  However, this broke the session manager access for other instances in this VPC. I requested my colleague Romesh to join the call for further assistance and he was able to point out that instead of adding subnet CIDR in the security group of VPC endpoint, we should add the VPC CIDR. Once we did that, the access to instances via Session Manager was restored for all the instances.   As discussed on call, I am marking the case as resolved. In case of any queries/concerns in future, please do reach out to us again via Support Centre.  We are always happy to help. Have a great day ahead!

As per our discussion, you had been experiencing issues with your user-data script, which had not been running the command that you had added to it. You tested this and the command had worked successfully when using it manually. You wanted to know how you can view the log for user-data, in order to determine how to resolve the issue at hand.  After doing some troubleshooting with you, we had found that you have a log file called user-data.log. When reviewing this log, we found that your script had run into a fatal error, before reaching the command that you added. The fatal error had been related to a script file which could not be found.   You then mentioned that you will look for this file, and add it. Should you not be able to find the file, you would attempt to remove it from the user-data script, if it is not required. Once you had done this, you would get back to me with the outcome, whether successful or not.  =================== As a side note, the user-data.log file is not a default log on the instance.

8037081761,Wynk Limited,Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2 - Linux),APAC,INDIA,satpilla,"Hello Sourabh,  Thank you for your time on chat session today, it was pleasure assisting you. As promised, below is a short summary of the chat session we had:  You reached out to us to check if it is possible to convert the x86_64 based AMI to ARM based AMI for your cluster as you are using a custom x86_64 architecture based AMI.  As informed on chat session both x84_64 and ARM are different architectures. There are some fundamental differences[1] at the architecture level itself. So, we can say that these are not compatible with one another. Since, there are differences in both the architectures at the very basic hardware level, it is not possible to modify the AMI/instances running x86_64 architecture to ARM or launch a graviton(ARM) architecture instance from an AMI created from an x86_64 architecture based instance.  That being said, it is possible to mount the x86_64 architecture based EBS volumes as a secondary volumes in the ARM (graviton) instances assuming that the filesystem is supported on the instance. However, please note that the root volume from x86_64 based instance cannot be attached as a primary volume on the ARM (graviton) instance but can be attached as a secondary volume if required. You may also check AWS link[2] to know more details about Graviton processors and instances.  I hope the information provided over the session was helpful. As confirmed on chat, I will mark the case as closed. Please feel free to open a new case if you have any further queries or concerns and we would be happy to assist you further.

My name is Kush and I will be assisting you with this case.  It was pleasure having a conversation with you. This email is a summary of our conversation over chat.  You reached out to us as you wanted to have some updates done on your Ec2 server.  So in order to help you with that we went on a screen share session where we checked the version for each of the packages mentioned by you using the below commands.  $ yum list installed | grep -i xorg-x11-server-Xorg $ yum list installed | grep -i xorg-x11-server-common $ yum list installed | grep -i net-snmp-libs   $ yum list installed | grep -i net-snmp-utils   $ yum list installed | grep -i sudo  And after observing the output of these commands we confirmed that the current packages installed on your instance were having the same version which was required by you. Here is the list of packages with their respective versions installed on your instance.  Package Name                              Installed Version     xorg-x11-server-Xorg             1.17.4-18.46.al12-x86_64 xorg-x11-server-common           1.17.4-18.46.al12-x86_64 net-snmp-libs                     1:5.5-60.22.al12-x86_64 net-snmp-utils                   1:5.5-60.22.al12-x86_64 sudo                             1.8.6p3-29.30.al12-x86_64  And as these were already installed so no further action was required. With that being said we decided to close the case, hence I am marking the case as resolved please feel free to raise a new case for any new issue.

My name is Joe, and I will be assisting with your case today.    I understand that you're seeing failures when attempting to install packages on i-04adba99f54a4bd3a. In particular, the installation process is seeing errors along the lines of the following:    insserv: warning: script 'S65nifi' missing LSB tags and overrides   insserv: Script nagios is broken: incomplete LSB comment.   insserv: missing `Default-Start:'  entry: please add even if empty.   insserv: missing `Default-Stop:'   entry: please add even if empty.   insserv: warning: script 'nifi' missing LSB tags and overrides  These errors are causing dpkg, the base package manager of Ubuntu, to fail. It does look like this is a system administration issue, which generally isn't within the scope of support (https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/faqs/#issue-types) as we cannot see inside your instance, and can't know all the changes that have been made, so you might be better off contacting your system administrator for help with this as they will be familiar with your configuration.

I understand that you ran an update on the instance i-00898073a7f5acdad, and afterwards the instance was failing instance level status checks failing to bring up the network. You were seeing the errors as per below.

You were seeing issues with python2.7 during the update and dependency issues on around 11 packages. As noted the 600+ packages that needed to be updated likely mean the instance has not been updated in a while. The likely root cause of the other instance failing checks is that the python update issue was not resolved resulting in a broken python2.7 package.

8077525521,Jubilant FoodWorks Limited,Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2 - Linux),APAC,INDIA,pagquilr,"Hello,  Thanks replying back.  To answer your questions, please see below inline.  1. All the given below volumes IOPS is 1500 however below response you mentioned that not hitting 3000 IOPS. Could you also confirm is spike in IOPS causing the issue?  - Sorry for the confusion. EBS gp2 volumes with less than 1TB in size can burst to 3000IOPS when there is burst credit. In other words gp2 volumes with 500GB in size can go beyond their baseline 1500 IOPS up to 3000IOPS as long as they have credits and will get throttled to the baseline value when credit is zero (0), see [1]. But, if the workload requires more than 3000IOPS, then performance degradation may occur even with full credit. Since the mentioned volumes did not deplete their burst credits, then it suggests that the volumes' current specification can handle the workload.  - Based on the analysis on the metrics available to us, the volume level limits were not hit and may not be the cause of the slowness experienced on your side. However, since the maximum granularity of the data we have is 1-minute, we can not see IO activity in much smaller granularity (e.g. 1-second) as there might be spikes which could have hit the IOPS limit.   2. Also please confirm spike in instance IOPS during given timestamp.  - For your EC2 instance IOPS, see below estimate values I observed during the time mentioned. Please note the IOPS values below are sum of IOPS of the active volumes during the time frame and most of them were the EBS volumes you mentioned.  2021-03-02 17:00 to 18:00 UTC mostly at ~16K, peaked around ~23k at 17:52 2021-03-03 22:45 to 23:00 UTC mostly at ~16k, peaked around ~43k at 23:13  2021-03-05 17:00 UTC   ~18K 2021-03-06 08:30 UTC   ~29k 2021-03-07 05:30 UTC   ~41k  - I compared these values to the IOPS value I obtained from my test EC2 using r4.8xlarge. I can see the IOPS values above are still less than r4.8xlarge type can achieve. However, again since we do not have the read and write metrics with 1-second granularity, we can not confirm whether the I","Mar 7, 2021",RE:[CASE 8077525521] User facing slowness,"March 10, 2021 3:28:34",3,iop response iop iop sorry confusion size credit word size baseline credit baseline credit see workload performance degradation credit burst credit specification workload analysis limit slowness side granularity activity granularity spike iop limit iop iop estimate iop sum iop frame utc test iop read granularity

One of the configured repositories failed (Docker CE Nightly - x86_64),  and yum doesn't have enough cached data to continue. At this point the only  safe thing yum can do is fail. There are a few ways to work ""fix"" this:       1. Contact the upstream for the repository and get them to fix the problem.       2. Reconfigure the baseurl/etc. for the repository, to point to a working         upstream. This is most often useful if you are using a newer         distribution release than is supported by the repository (and the         packages for the previous distribution release still work).       3. Run the command with the repository temporarily disabled             yum --disablerepo=docker-ce-nightly ...       4. Disable the repository permanently, so yum won't use it by default. Yum         will then just ignore the repository until you permanently enable it         again or use --enablerepo for temporary usage:              yum-config-manager --disable docker-ce-nightly         or             subscription-manager repos --disable=docker-ce-nightly       5. Configure the failing repository to be skipped, if it is unavailable.         Note that yum will try to contact the repo. when it runs most commands,         so will have to try and fail each time (and thus. yum will be be much         slower). If it is a very temporary problem though, this is often a nice         compromise:              yum-config-manager --save --setopt=docker-ce-nig","Mar 8, 2021",Chat: Not able to install docker on the EC2 instance,"March 8, 2021 5:38:53",4,docker yum install docker plugins priority b docker xml mirror repository yum point thing yum way contact upstream repository problem reconfigure repository upstream distribution release run repository repository default yum repository usage repos configure repository yum repo problem compromise

Before starting any further, I would like to inform you that single subnet/AZ cluster is not supported on AWS. You need to have the nodes in different subnets/AZ's.You will have to re-deploy a node in another AZ.  I did not find your domain controller on AWS and on checking further I am assuming the DC is located on on-prem infrastructure and is connected to AWS through Direct Connect/Virtual Transit Gateway. I also see that you have configured the route tables accordingly so that the instances can communicate with the DC.  Coming to the error message, you can ignore the error related to Network configuration as that is the default behavior on AWS environment. The error related to Active directory configuration can also be ignored provided we have verified the facts as per the article. https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/troubleshoot/windows-server/high-availability/cluster-validation-test-fails-multi-site-cluster-scenario  I am attaching a document which you can refer to understand and configure an Always On SQL cluster on AWS. Please go through it and try the configuration again and let me know in case you have any queries. Also it would be better if we can engage on a screenshare session to understand the actual behavior and get the details about your infrastructure to troubleshoot better.

My name is Himanshu and I will be assisting you with the case today.  From the case description, I understand that you want to automate deregistering EC2 Instances from the Load Balancer and have some queries around it. Please correct me if I misunderstood something.   An EC2 Instance is transitioned from Unhealthy state to OutOfService after subsequent failed attempts by load balancer to confirm the connectivity. I found an article written by AWS which can help you trigger Lambda function based on the metric ""UnHealthyHostCount"" for your Load Balancer. Let me explain the flow,  AWS CloudWatch Alarm ---Triggers----> SNS Notification -----Triggers----> AWS Lambda   Inside the Lambda function you can trigger the load balancer API calls to identify the failed host and you register a new host accordingly. Please refer the article below: [+] https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/networking-and-content-delivery/identifying-unhealthy-targets-of-elastic-load-balancer/  Note - This Alarm will get triggered based on ""UnHealthyHostCount"" metric and not the status ""OutOfService"" you can configure the alarm in such a way that it waits for 2-3 consecutive checks for a period of 4-5 minutes before triggering the alarm. This will provide some room for transient issues (if any) with the Instances.   ** I also checked EventBridge but I couldn't find appropriate rule to trigger the Lambda functions based on your requirements.   Please let me know if this will suffice your use case.   I hope the provided information is beneficial to you. In case you feel I missed out to address something more to your concern, or if we can otherwise provide any additional assistance with regard to this matter, please do not hesitate to let us know.

You reached out as you were having issues converting your instance ""i-0eefc0f45c5126bc4"" from T2  and moving it to a T3 instance  type.  To best assist you on this regard, I did inform you there are some prerequisites that need to be meet before migrating to Nitro instance  types. The checks can be seen by having to run the script on the documentation link[1]. The script is named ""  NitroInstanceChecks "".   When you ran the script, we could  see the output was complaining about the ENA module not being present on the instance. To fix this issue, I did run you through the below commands which you can run on the instance  to instance the ENA module.  The steps we executed are as follows:    $ sudo yum install kernel-devel-$(uname -r) gcc git patch rpm-build wget -y  $ cd /usr/src/  $ sudo wget https://github.com/amzn/amzn-drivers/archive/master.zip  $ sudo unzip master.zip  $ cd amzn-drivers-master/kernel/linux/ena  $ sudo make   $ sudo cp ena.ko /lib/modules/$(uname -r)/  $ sudo depmod  The above commands did successfully install the module.

The issue we faced regarding Networking configuration was also fixed as seen on case [8089747261].

Myself Vediyappan and I'm happy to assist you on this case today.  From the case notes, I understand that you would like to limit the access for the EC2 users running inside the instance with  IAM profile role attached and provide different access to the users.  Please allow me to mention that, an instance profile can contain only one IAM role, although a role can be included in multiple instance profiles. When attached the instance profile role to the EC2 instance, the users or applications inside the instance, able to obtains temporary security credentials from Amazon EC2 instance metadata. These are temporary security credentials that represent the role and are valid for a limited period of time.  - https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/iam-roles-for-amazon-ec2.html#ec2-instance-profile  Also note that, AWS CLI uses credentials and configuration settings located in multiple places, such as the system or user environment variables, local AWS configuration files, or explicitly declared on the command line as a parameter. Certain locations take precedence over others  As per the credentials order mentioned in the following link, the instance profile role credentials will be the last one.   - https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-configure-quickstart.html#cli-configure-quickstart-precedence  Therefore, for the users doesn't want to gain the instance profile role access, you can configure the AWS credentials in individual user home directory (e.g /home/ec2-user/.aws). When the user runs the AWS CLI command, IAM user credentials are used for API calls as user credentials have a higher precedence than role credentials hence the user will get the different access by default.  For example,   1. You can create the IAM user (programatic access only) with restricted role for the user N.  2. Login to the instance as user N, run the ""aws configure"" command to configure the AWS credentials for this user.  - https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli","Mar 10, 2021",RE:[CASE 8089183421] Chat: Provisioning specific privileges to the user,"March 10, 2021 11:20:03",4,role profile role role profile role obtains credential metadata credential role period cli credential setting place environment variable line parameter location precedence others credential order role credential therefore role credential home cli iam credential api credential precedence role credential default example role login n configure credential

Please refer to below mentioned CloudWatch graph:   a. https://ap-southeast-1.console.aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/deeplink.js?region=ap-southeast-1#metricsV2:graph=%7B%22metrics%22%3A%5B%5B%22AWS%2FEC2%22%2C%22StatusCheckFailed_Instance%22%2C%22InstanceId%22%2C%22i-0798c00e07a1654c1%22%5D%5D%2C%22stat%22%3A%22Maximum%22%2C%22period%22%3A300%2C%22start%22%3A%222021-03-10T05%3A50%3A40.649Z%22%2C%22end%22%3A%222021-03-15T05%3A50%3A40.649Z%22%2C%22region%22%3A%22ap-southeast-1%22%7D  2. I also observed that instance was stuck in a reboot loop.  3. Upon refreshing the instance screenshot, we found the error message stating ""Your PC Ran Into a Problem and Needs to Restart"". Post this instance reboots automatically.  4. Thereafter, we tried to use EC2Rescue [1] to perform Last known good configuration; however, that did not work. Please refer to next section for more details.  5. We also tried to create the root volume from last healthy snapshot; however, issue remained persistent.  6. Thereafter, we again detached the impacted root volume ""vol-0c211c24f8293af25"" from impacted instance and attached it to the test instance and ran the following command:   a. dism /image:E:\ /cleanup-image /revertpendingactions   b. However, issue remained the same.  7. Finally, we used an AMI  (created from the instance) and were able to successfully launch an instance ""i-0ec88658e5794c202"" which passed both the status checks.  Use EC2Rescue for Restore operation: =====================================  We can use EC2Rescue 'Restore' option in ","Mar 15, 2021","RE:[CASE 8106720311] Chat: Status Check Alarm: ""AIRVTRAWSMEDIA-SOC","March 15, 2021 10:06:16",4,greeting conversation conversation refer cloud watch graph j reboot loop screenshot pc problem post section snapshot test dism restore operation option

Please find a brief summary of our conversation below.  You reached out to us as you had some queries regarding scheduled instance maintenance for the instance i-0d9c9bf596100ff9d.   I informed that the instance is scheduled for maintenance and you can stop-start the instance to migrate it to a healthy hardware.  Later you stop started the instance and I investigated and informed that instance seems to be running in healthy host as of now and is passing both status checks.  You informed that previously you faced an issue where you had to stop-start the another instance twice.  I informed that after stop-starting the instance will move to different healthy host, However, as hardware failures are unpredictable we cannot comment regarding the future. Hardware and network failures do inevitably occur in every environment. We try our best to restrict the downtime caused by such failures to be very brief.I sincerely apologize for any inconvenience caused due the issue.   I also shared the below links regarding changing the node type for your elasticache redis cluster and suggested you to reach out to our elasticache team for more details as there might be some effects.  - https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonElastiCache/latest/red-ug/Scaling.RedisReplGrps.ScaleDown.html  - https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonElastiCache/latest/red-ug/Clusters.Modify.html   If you have any queries feel free to reach out to us and we will be glad to assist you.

As informed, there is no such uptime information we publish for EC2 instance types. Any instance can go unavailable because of any hardware issues as such i.e the SLA we promise is for all instance types. The SLA information for EC2 is mentioned here:   https://aws.amazon.com/compute/sla/  Also, there is no such drawbacks as compared to M5 and M5a, it depends on your use case. It would be suggested to use these instance types if you are looking for high performance at low cost. You can benchmark the performances for these instance types and check as to which one suits your use case. It is supported by most of the OS distributions except windows. These instance types are mostly recommended for Applications built on open-source software such as application servers, microservices, gaming servers, mid-size data stores, and caching fleets.

8112870421,HDFC Life Insurance Company Limited,Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2 - Linux),APAC,INDIA,moegalli,"Hi Adil, Allie here from the AWS Cape Town team.  As discussed during our call, I believe that the reason for both SSM and SSH not working is that Cloud-init, the program that executes userdata script, is not running on instance ' i-0537eebc1fea5fa4e'. I do however see it running on instance 'i-07e97fad3e2049020' as I was able see the this line in its console logs:    Starting cloud-init: Cloud-init v. 0.7.5 running 'init' at Tue, 16 Mar 2021 03:15:47 +0000. Up 33.24 seconds.  Regardless, I recommend making use of a recovery instance for troubleshooting the issue with SSH. Here are the steps to follow:  Create a new instance in the same region and availability zone as your current instances, ap-south-1a. Create this instance with the SSH key that you intend to use going forward.  After creating the instance, detach the volume of the impaired instance and then reattach to the recovery instance:    1. From the Amazon EC2 console, in the navigation pane, choose Volumes.   2. Select a volume and choose Actions, Detach Volume.   3. In the confirmation dialog box, choose Yes, Detach.   4. Select a volume and choose Actions, Attach Volume.   5. In the 'Attach Volume' dialog box, click inside of the 'Instance' text field and select the recovery instance, then click 'Attach'.  SSH to the new recovery instance and mount the volume of impaired instance using these commands:  1. List the block devices attached to your instance:   # lsblk  2. Mount the volume from the original instance inside the recovery instance (I'm using /dev/xvdf in my example, use the correct device name that was found with ""lsblk""):   # mount /dev/xvdf /mnt/  With the volume mounted, we can go ahead with troubleshooting. Compare and alter the SSH configuration of the impaired instance to that of the recovery instance:  Run these commands to gather the working SSH configuration of the working recovery instance:    # cat /etc/ssh/ssh_config   # cat /home/ec2-user/.ssh/authorized_keys   # ls -la /home/ec2-user/.ssh/   # ls -la /home/ec2-user/   # ls -la ","Mar 16, 2021",RE:[CASE 8112870421] Chat: Unable to ssh instance,"March 16, 2021 11:49:12",4,adil allie cape town ssm ssh program script see line tue use recovery ssh availability zone ssh key recovery navigation pane confirmation dialog box dialog box inside field recovery ssh recovery block device lsblk recovery mount compare ssh recovery recovery cat cat l l l

You would like to know the reason behind the unexpected shutdown event . Please feel free to correct me if my understanding is wrong.  I started my investigation by checking system performance metrics and could see that there was an EC2 instance reboot flexible maintenance scheduled event for the instance i-0bc714ff396e35d1b scheduled for 2021-03-15 18:00:00 UTC.

At any time before 2021-03-15 18:00:00 UTC, you can reschedule this maintenance or stop and start the instance through the AWS API, AWS CLI, or AWS Management Console. When rescheduling, you can pick any time up to 2021-03-31 17:00:00 UTC, at which EC2 will perform maintenance on the instance. Otherwise, you can wait for EC2 to reboot your instance during the scheduled maintenance window.

This is just a brief summary of our conversation.   You reached out to us as you were unable to access Internet from the instance i-047350f756072c3c7. I reviewed the instance configurations and saw that it allowed outbound traffic over port 443,80 to 0.0.0.0 in the security group rules. Also, its route table had a route to the internet via IGW. However, there was no public IP/elastic IP associated with the instance. I mentioned to you that when you use IGW for internet connectivity, you would need to have a public IP attached to the network interface of the instance, in order to access internet. You went ahead and attached and elastic IP post which you got internet connectivity.  Then you mentioned that you were unable to open a session via Session manager from the instance. I saw that the instance’s IAM role had permissions for Session manager operations and was also reporting as Online under Managed Instances in Systems manager. After a minute you mentioned that you were now able to start a session via Session manager. I believe it was a transient issue wherein it took a couple of minutes to contact the session manager endpoints. Also, you confirmed that the issue did not persist.

Thank you for your time over chat and screenshare today. It was a pleasure working with you.  Please find a summary of our session today.  You had come to us as you were unable to connect to you EC2 instance i-0427669dcfd0c15b2 and required our assistance with the same. Over chat you mentioned that you were unable to connect via SSM or SSH despite status checks showing 2/2 passing.  When I pulled up the instance I noticed that SSM Status on my internal tools was showing as “Online” at which point, I asked you to try connecting to the instance using SSM. You confirmed that you were able to connect to the instance after restarting it. Looking at the timestamps of how the case progressed, I strongly believe that there were no issues on the instance, however, the instance just needed a couple of minutes to boot properly and launch all the services.  Nevertheless, I would suggest you to go through the system logs located at /var/log/messages to see if the operating system had any issues during the time or was it just the normal flow. If you have any other queries, please feel free to raise a new case with us or reach back on this one. We would be delighted to help you.  I hope you have a safe and an enjoyable weekend ahead! 🙂  We value your feedback.

8151770381,Zee Entertainment Enterprises Ltd,Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2 - Linux),APAC,INDIA,isiaho,"Good day,  Harun here from AWS Premium Support. It was a pleasure chatting with you today.   To recap our conversation, you reached out to us because you had configured secondary IPs on EC2 instances but the IPs were not reachable.  After reviewing the EC2 instance 'i-0cb2c3f9541efc2a', I noticed that you had configured two Network Interfaces in the same subnets. As mentioned on chat, adding a secondary network interface to a non-Amazon Linux EC2 instance causes traffic flow issues. These issues occur because the primary and secondary network interfaces are in the same subnet, and there is one routing table with one gateway. Traffic that comes into the secondary network interface leaves the instance using the primary network interface. But this isn't allowed, because the secondary IP address doesn't belong to the MAC address of the primary network interface.  I suggested you consider using a secondary IP on the same interface as per the guide below   - https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/MultipleIP.html#ManageMultipleIP  Then configure the secondary IP on the OS level by editing the following file   - /etc/netplan/50-cloud-init.yaml  Below is an example template you can review.   -------------------------------------------------------------  network:      ethernets:          eth0:              addresses:                  - 172.31.5.24/20               dhcp4: true              dhcp6: false              match:                  macaddress: 02:32:0a:4e:62:07              set-name: eth0      version: 2  -------------------------------------------------------------  After updating the secondary IP, run the command below to apply the configuration   $ sudo netplan apply --debug   Run the command below to confirm if the new IP has been applied.   $ ip addr  We performed the above steps in your test environment and you confirmed it worked as expected.

Thank you for sending in the atop logs of 29th March.   The Atop results provided just has the CPU utilization information and as we suspect the issue might have been caused by the memory consumption, we would require the details about the memory consumption.

Thank you for reaching out to AWS Premium Support, my name is Neani and I'll be assisting you with this case while my colleague Bode is unavailable.  Reading from the case notes, I understand that you currently trying to perform an in-place upgrade from Windows server 2012 R2 to Windows server 2019 and you are facing some issues with the same. Please feel free to correct me if there is any misunderstanding.  Thank you for providing feedback from the recommended action plan from my colleague.  From the description I understand that you have completed the upgrade before on other servers successfully. Therefore we may need to further isolate the issue from this instance  i-840a625c in particular where the upgrade is failing.  Please perform the following:  1. As part of troubleshooting this issue, can you detach all the currently attached EBS volumes from the instance and only leave the root volume (vol-a9f6066a) 2. Then after try to perform the in-place upgrade once more 3. Should you still face issues do this for further testing:  3.1 Create AMI of the instance i-840a625c  3.2 Launch a new instance from the AMI  3.3 Use ""AWSEC2-CloneInstanceAndUpgradeWindows"" please see the link for the same here [1]  3.4 The purpose for the above is to try and rule out which step is the upgrade failing on 4. Could you also advise any difference which is in place between this server which has issues and the servers which the upgrade completed   Please let me know the outcome of the recommended next action plan.  I hope the provided information would be helpful, please feel free to reach me out if you have any additional queries. I would be glad to assist you.

8173577871,Wizrocket Inc,Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2 - Linux),APAC,INDIA,prasos,"Hello,   Thank you for contacting AWS premium support. My name is Prasobh and I will be assisting you on this case.   From your case correspondence, I am a bit confused. As per your statement, you are trying for an IAM policy using which you can stop instances based on specific tags and keys. But IAM policies are for specifying the permissions and authorities of an user or group. It can't directly stop or modify an instance. Modification of instance state can be done using CLI commands only. I am explaining both in this reply.   If you are creating an IAM policy for stopping the instance with specific tag and key, you can use the policy in the following documentation, You just need to remove the ""ec2:StartInstances"" from Actions.   ------ https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/reference_policies_examples_ec2-start-stop-tags.html ------  Once the policy is created, you can attach it to the user or group and they will have access only to stop the specific instances.   Incase if you are looking for an option to stop instances with specific tags, then it can be achieved using the AWS CLI. You can use a combination for stop-instances and describe-instances CLI calls for achieving this.

Please find a brief summary of discussion below:  You reached out to us as you were unable to extend partition of the volume: vol-0c7f9ea00a574b6f1 using growpart. There were three partitions present on the volume. I informed you that you cannot increase the size of second partition directly using growpart command. Hence, we recreated the partitions using fdisk command:  # fdisk /dev/nvme1n1  we pressed p -->> then d -->> 2 -->> d -->> 3 -->> n -->> p -->> created primary partition of size 10GB -->> n -->> p -->> created another primary partition of size 10GB -->>> w   However, when we ran partprobe so that kernel uses new partition table, it asked us to reboot the instance to use new partition table. After rebooting the instance it was not reachable as ssh service did not come up. We attached the root volume and vol-0c7f9ea00a574b6f1 to a rescue instance and checked if the data present on both the partitions is intact or not. The filesystem on second partition was present but there was no filesystem on the third partition. First we extended the filesystem present on second partition using resize2fs command and then we copied the data from backup volume created from snapshot: snap-0a4e089d14e7b973b. We attached the volumes back to the original instance and connected to it using SSM. We saw that ssh service was failing to come up as /var/empty/sshd was not present. This should have been automatically created however it might be possible due to lack of permissions it was not created and SELinux was also enabled so even that could cause the permission issue. Hence, we added below commands in /etc/rc.local so that /var/empty/sshd is created automatically on instance boot:  mkdir /var/empty cd /var/empty mkdir sshd mkdir sshd/etc cd /var/empty/sshd/etc ln -s /etc/localtime localtime  We also disabled SELinux to rule out issues because of that by running setenforce 0.

Thank you for your time over the chat today. It was my pleasure working with you.  You reached out to as your zabix tools has reported 'Apache down' error on EC2 instance ( i-0cd5cf2e45f110169) at 8th Apr 07:46 UTC.  We then checked that CPU was ~30% during that time.

I will not be able to examine the Network Configuration of that Instance as it is terminated. Could you please confirm if you are still encountering the issue with connectivity.   Make sure ICMP traffic is not blocked on the EC2 Instances   - Security Groups of Destination Instances must allow traffic from IP CIDR or IP Address of the Source Instance. - Ensure that the ICMP traffic is allowed in the Firewall and Antivirus (if any) - You could test by disabling firewall on the destination Instances by running the command in command prompt (run as Administrator): NetSh Advfirewall set allprofiles state off  If you are still encountering any issues please share the Instance ID or Security Group ID, NACL ID (Network Access Control List) for us to examine the rules.

You contacted as, you observed AMI created from i-0fb4fc728728e0eb7 EC2 instance was failing and you required further help from us to find out the reason behind it.  Please find below summary of our conversation regarding this issue,  -->You confirmed that you creates AMI from i-0fb4fc728728e0eb7 EC2 instance every 15 minute and deletes the older one at every 30 minutes using Lambda function.

It was a pleasure chatting to you earlier.   Below is a brief summary of our session.  You had encountered issues with your application whereby 4xx errors have been reported intermittently when trying to reach the instance metadata endpoint.

8208793331,TriCore Solutions Private Limited,Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2 - Linux),APAC,INDIA,pmmulon,"Hello,  This is Paul again from AWS Premium Support. Thank you for your patience.  Please note that after you increase the size of an EBS volume, you must use file system–specific commands to extend the file system to the larger size. You can resize the file system as soon as the volume enters the optimizing state. Kindly refer to the following article [1].  To extend the Linux file system, refer to the following steps: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/recognize-expanded-volume-linux.html#extend-file-system-nvme     From the 'lsblk' output you have shared, I observed that you also have a volume using LVM, i.e. nvme2n1p1. To extend an LVM file system, use the following steps:   - Modify the size of the existing EBS volume from the AWS console: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/requesting-ebs-volume-modifications.html#modify-ebs-volume   - Resize the physical volume.    $ sudo pvresize /dev/nvme2n1p1   - View the physical volume details:    $ sudo pvs   - View the volume group's details:    $ sudo vgs   - Extend the logical volume (Note: replace the logical volume name and size):     $ sudo lvextend -L 19G /dev/Dock/station1   - View the logical volume's details:    $ sudo lvs    LV        VG            Attr       LSize  Pool Origin Data%  Meta%  Move Log Cpy%Sync Convert   station1  Dock          -wi-a----- 19.00g   - Extend the file system:   Note: Depending on your use case, follow the steps for XFS or Ext2, Ext3, and Ext4 file systems. Also replace '/dev/Dock/station1' with the name of your of your logical volume.   Ext2, Ext3, and Ext4 file systems:    $ sudo resize2fs /dev/Dock/station1   XFS file systems:    $ sudo yum install xfsprogs      $ sudo xfs_growfs /dev/Dock/station1  An alternative method of extending logical volumes is to add additional EBS volumes to your volume group. If you are interested in this approach, kindly refer to the 'Extend the logical volume' section on this link [2].  I hope the above information is insightful.

My name is Kevin and it will be my pleasure to assist you with this case today.  I understand that you have an instance that is not displaying its OS type in the console.   From a Service standpoint the Operating system type is defined by the AMI that the instance is launched from.  Considering the instance i-0fe229da611416276, I have noted this instance is a Red Hat Enterprise Linux Server release 7.2 according to the console log. As this case was logged to the EC2 Windows team, I don't have any specific Linux experience, but the fundamental process for changing the showing OS is common to all Ec2.  In order to change the displayed OS: Launch a new instance in the same sub-net of the OS type you want. Then remove the volume(s) from the the new instance, and attach the volume from the your old instance as the root volume on this new server.  Then the new server will be the old server, but showing the new servers OS type, and thus displaying the type that you need.  Note: for expert guidance in future it is best to open the case with the correct team for that service/Os type (In this case Ec2-Linux).   I trust this information to be helpful.

You also indicated that you had previously attempted to address this issue by resizing the instance from t2 to t3 and finally to c5 instance type but still no luck. You also indicated that you were regularly noticing your EBS burst balance draining to zero and wanted to know what was causing that.

You indicated that the instance was a sandbox and you were not keen on extending the volume size and so opted to create some space on the root EBS volume by deleting some files.

I believe I've managed to find a way around this for you. I disabled SSH key injection on cloud-init itself. In the config file located in ""/etc/cloud/cloud.cfg"", you will find the modules. It looks like this (may be slightly different for different distributions as I replicated on an Amazon Linux 2 machine):  cloud_init_modules:  - migrator  - bootcmd  - write-files  - write-metadata  - amazonlinux_repo_https  - growpart  - resizefs  - set-hostname  - update-hostname  - update-etc-hosts  - rsyslog  - users-groups  - ssh  - resolv-conf  I simply removed the SSH module [1], which is responsible for injecting the authorized_keys file. I then updated authorized_keys to use a new key. I ran ""cloud-init clean"" and also rebooted the machine. The old key no longer gets injected. If you remove the ""authorized_keys"" file at this point, you will have no access at all, as the old key is not generated anymore. That being said, just a word of caution; Ensure that you've added a new key to the ""authorized_keys"" file after deleting that module.  If you're still up/available, you can also let me know and I'll be happy to go over this with you on a call/screenshare.  Looking forward to hearing back from you soon.

You reached out to us as you were unable to connect to your MongoDB database hosted on EC2 instance (Instance ID: i-0032e4467f765ae0f) from the following instance (Instance ID: i-06408284dd86da564) on TCP Port 27017.  I investigated both instances and I could confirm that they were running, passing all health checks and that there were no issues with their respective underlying hardware.   I could confirm that both instances were in the same VPC and that their Network ACLs and route table were properly configured and that the source instance private IP address was whitelisted in the Security Group of the instance hosting MongoDB (Instance ID: i-0032e4467f765ae0f). You confirmed on your end that the MongoDB application was running and that it was reachable from other instances in the same VPC.  The issue was due to the way you were accessing the MongoDB application: you were connecting using the public IP of the MongoDB instance - 13.127.238.183:27017 - which would have resulted in connection being established over the public Internet. This meant that the source IP address (of the connection) as seen by the MongoDB instance (Instance ID: i-0032e4467f765ae0f) would be instance (Instance ID: i-06408284dd86da564) public IP address while only its private IP address was whitelisted in the Security Groups.   To confirm, we tested by establishing connection with the MongoDB instance (Instance ID: i-0032e4467f765ae0f) over its private IP address on TCP Port 27017 and it completed successfully.   I recommended that you setup your application running on the instance (Instance ID: i-06408284dd86da564) to connect to the MongoDB application privately as this is the more secure method, and because the instance (Instance ID: i-06408284dd86da564) is restarted every day which changes its public IP address (no Elastic IP associated).

To recap, you reach out to AWS support because you wanted to reset the local administrator password for your Active Directory.  You have attempted to reset the Local Administrator password using the EC2Rescue but you are still not able to get the password from the AWS console. We were able to use SSM Run command to reset the password using the command    net user Administrator W3lcome123!  But you were still getting the error message below:   ""To sign in remotely, you need the right to sign in through Remote Desktop Services.""   As discussed, the error message is not password related. The user has not been granted remote desktop access. The policy is usually pushed via group policy. Looking at the group policy from the group Policy Management console, we see that there are policies restricting access.   You enforced the default policy and also add administrator to the account that can login. Then you were able to login.  As agreed on chat, I will set the case to resolve.  We value your feedback.

It was a pleasure talking with you on chat earlier today.  You reached out to us today as you wanted to know why your instance ID 'i-0a2d56baccb9ffb91' had failed instance status checks twice in this week.  During our chat I mentioned, that I observed on two occasions from cloudWatch report here [1]  the instance failed instance status checks on  06-04-2021 10:45UTC and 13-04-202108:05 UTC. However during this period , this week I did not observe an system status check failures.   The following are examples of problems that can cause instance status checks to fail as here [2]:    • Incorrect networking or startup configuration  • Exhausted memory  • Corrupted file system  • Incompatible kernel  I also mentioned that from internal tools, I checked the instance console/system logs and did not find any errors reported that could lead to this failure. Over our screen share we checked message, dmesg and application logs , however we did not also find any specific errors. However you mentioned that this issue occurs after you perform a deployment on the server.  Therefore as we have no historical data on memory/disk performance . I  did suggest installing   System Activity Reporter ""sar"" [3] [4] on the instance to keep a log of your system loads i.e. CPU activity, device load etc. These are third party tools, which are commonly used for do historical analysis of Linux machines.  Finally we agreed that you would further check internally with your developers to identify any JVM/memory requirements on the spring boot app during deployment. However Should you have any further issues or need additional clarification, please feel free to get back to us and we will be happy to assist you.

8220172361,ALL_DEPRECATED,Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2 - Linux),APAC,INDIA,vatsalt,"Hello Arpit,  Thank you for your time over chat today. It was a pleasure working with you.  You reached out to us as you had few queries around rDNS of IP addresses.   We discussed that a public (external) DNS hostname takes the form ec2-public-ipv4-address.compute-1.amazonaws.com for the us-east-1 Region, and ec2-public-ipv4-address.region.compute.amazonaws.com for other Regions. So, when you run host on any IP, it also resolves to the above default DNS names.   Further, we discussed that it is possible to assign custom rDNS record for your IP, but it is only possible for the Elastic IPs, and not default public IPs. You can create PTR records for any number of elastic IPs.  For some regions you may be able to update directly from console: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/elastic-ip-addresses-eip.html#Using_Elastic_Addressing_Reverse_DNS  But for others you can submit the email limit removal form and submit the rDNS record there: https://console.aws.amazon.com/support/contacts?#/rdns-limits  I hope our session was useful. As there were no further queries, I will mark the case as closed for your convenience.

The instance was launched from an AMI that was copied from another region. The Windows Instance run Active Directory.

As discussed, below is a quick recap for the conversation we had over the chat.   Issue: ******* Instance ""i-0d3f38c2da97f2c27"" automatically got terminated as soon as it was launched, even when the termination protection was turned on.   Summary: ************ Over the chat session you mentioned that you launched the instance manually from the console and enabled the termination protection still the instance was terminated just after launch. I reviewed the instance details from back-end and found that it was a C5.xlarge instance and currently in terminated state.   I then reviewed the instance Cloudtrail logs but couldn't find any useful info. I then explored the instance back-end logs using an internal tool and noticed an error: ""customer master key that does not exist, does not exist in this region, or you are not allowed to access."", which usually comes up when the volume/snapshot used to launch the instance is encrypted and the KMS key used to encrypt it is now not present in the region where you are trying to launch the instance. Hence, I reviewed the attached volumes details and confirmed that the volumes vol-00861099adabf988d (root) & vol-0a076423c82afa713 attached to the instance are encrypted with a KMS key.   The KMS key used was f2ae2945-xxxxx-xxxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxb129b.  Since you confirmed that you do not have this KMS key in the affected account, this clears the fact that when you tried to launch the instance with the encrypted volume/snapshot it failed because the KMS key used was not present in your account to decrypt it and hence the instance launch failed.  That said, I shared the articles [1] and [2] (video) which will help you to share the KMS key from one account to another and requested you to try the steps and offered a screenshare support as well.

8226040811,Ibibo Group,Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2 - Linux),APAC,INDIA,kmmumera,"Hi,  Kennedy from AWS support here again and this is a summary of the call. On the call you reached out to us because you want to protect your EC2 cluster from SSRF attack due to metadata service.  You can access instance metadata from a running instance using one of the following methods[1][2]:  - Instance Metadata Service Version 1 (IMDSv1) – a request/response method - Instance Metadata Service Version 2 (IMDSv2) – a session-oriented method  To mitigate against SSRF attacks, I kindly suggest that you use IMDSv2 or block the application to use metadata service[3]. IMDSv2 uses session-oriented requests. With session-oriented requests, you create a session token that defines the session duration, which can be a minimum of one second and a maximum of six hours. During the specified duration, you can use the same session token for subsequent requests. After the specified duration expires, you must create a new session token to use for future requests.  The following example uses a Linux shell script and IMDSv2 to retrieve the top-level instance metadata items. The example: - Creates a session token lasting six hours (21,600 seconds) using the PUT request - Stores the session token header in a variable named TOKEN - Requests the top-level metadata items using the token  When you use IMDSv2 to request instance metadata, the request must include the following:  1. Use a PUT request to initiate a session to the instance metadata service. The PUT request returns a token that must be included in subsequent GET requests to the instance metadata service. The token is required to access metadata using IMDSv2. 2. Include the token in all GET requests to the instance metadata service. When token usage is set to required, requests without a valid token or with an expired token receive a 401 - Unauthorized HTTP error code  IMDSv2’s combination of beginning a session with a PUT request, and then requiring the secret session token in other requests, is always strictly more effective than requiring only a static header.

I understand that you noticed a cpu spike near to 100% at around 4:59 UTC on 14th April 2021, on your instance i-03bfabb708852e34b which lasted for around 15 to 20 minutes till 5:15 UTC.

8240325711,Hotstar (Star TV India),Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2 - Linux),APAC,INDIA,waltmw,"Hi Amrit  Michael here from AWS, thanks for reaching out earlier today.  During our chat we discussed how you can work out the size of your incremental EBS snapshots/AMIs.  The first option is to make use of cost allocation tags for your EBS snapshots, this blog post does a good job of explaining the set up and shows example outputs of the generated reports [1].  Another option is to make use of the EBS direct APIs [2].     You can use the Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS) direct APIs to create EBS snapshots, write data directly to your snapshots, read data on your snapshots, and identify the differences or changes between two snapshots. If you’re an independent software vendor (ISV) who offers backup services for Amazon EBS, the EBS direct APIs make it more efficient and cost-effective to track incremental changes on your EBS volumes through snapshots. This can be done without having to create new volumes from snapshots, and then use Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instances to compare the differences.   It's important to understand the incremental nature of EBS snapshots when working with the above APIs. When you create an AMI of an instance, EBS snapshots of the attached volumes are taken. If you create further AMIs, the subsequent snapshots will only contain the 'changed' blocks between the earlier snapshots and the new snapshot. In order to calculate the amount of space consumed by these snapshots, you can use the two AWS CLI commands: list-snapshot-blocks https://awscli.amazonaws.com/v2/documentation/api/latest/reference/ebs/list-snapshot-blocks.html list-changed-blocks https://awscli.amazonaws.com/v2/documentation/api/latest/reference/ebs/list-changed-blocks.html   There is currently no way of retrieving the snapshot size from the EC2 console itself, either the EBS API must be used, or the above CLI commands. For examples on the usage of the above commands, you can take a look at the following section in the EBS direct APIs documentation: Use EBS direct APIs to access the contents of an EB","Apr 19, 2021",RE:[CASE 8240325711] Chat: AMI size,"April 19, 2021 11:41:51",4,amrit michael size option use cost allocation tag snapshot blog post job example output report option use block store apis snapshot snapshot snapshot difference change snapshot software vendor backup apis change snapshot snapshot compute cloud difference nature snapshot apis snapshot snapshot block snapshot snapshot order amount space snapshot cli way size api cli example usage look section apis use apis content eb

Ahmed here again from WS Premium Support; Here is a recap for what we have done.  You reached us as after modifying some instances from  Intel-based to AMD-based, the CPU utilization has been increased.   We have went into conference over chime and checked the at OS level and also using NewRelic software graphs :   -  we used the below commands :          $ top          $ pidstat 1          $ mpstat -P ALL 1    - All outputs confirms that the application processes are the same ( php and redis) and no other processes/applications are loaded.    - The CPU utilization at OS/NewRelic is different from CW metrics.    - The CPU load  increased and NetworkIn as well.  Based on the above checks we have did, I was not able to spot any abnormal thing that can increase the load as all processes that consume the CPU are related to PHP/redis. However, as agreed I'll rbe reaching back-end team to have another look at the issue.  Can you please provide the below for both instances   1- i-0a2c2a9daae994881      Was:m5.2xlarge (Intel) ==> Now: m5a.2xlarge (AMD)   2- i-03d63ee42e213ac6c     Was: c4.xlarge (Intel) ==> Now: c5a.xlarge(AMD)  From instance CLI :   $  mpstat  -P ALL 5    From NewRelic  :    1- screenshot of current CPU load.      ==> as i remember it should show around 40% CPU load    2- screenshot during the day you modified instance type and the load increased.

I have waited for 15-20 minutes on chime meeting for you to join however seems like you couldn't make it to the meeting so I am sharing the summary our previous conversation here.  You have reached out to us as one of your instance ""i-024c8d7fd4af74c60"" was failing instance status check. During the call you have informed me that you have removed python3.6 from your instance yesterday. Regarding python3.6 removal as  communicated in my previous correspondence I would like to inform you that removing python3 package will remove the cloud-init  and several other packages dependent on python3.6 on your operating system. Cloud-init and netplan packages are actually responsible for bringing up the network on ec2-instance and since they have been removed as part of python3.6 removal, the instance has lost its automatic network loading capability due to missing packages and failing instance status check [1]  During screen share session, we troubleshooted the issue by detaching and attaching the root volume of your impaired instance  and attached it to a recovery instance. We then checked the network configuration files under /etc/netplan/50-cloud-init.yaml and   /etc/udev/rules.d/70-persistent-net.rules and everything looks fine. Further as informed oncall troubleshooting this issue falls under system administration tasks [1] which falls out of our scope of support and assistance can be provided on best-effort basis only.  I tried assisting you on screen share however it didn't fix the issue because removal of python3.6 has broken instance default network configuration. Therefore as suggested please launch a new instance and copy all your data to this newly created instance.  Lastly I would also like to suggest you to always keep backup of your instances, before performing any changes(like removing packages or making any configuration changes) on the instances, by creating it's snapshot/AMI so that you always have the option to restore them from backup if somet","Apr 21, 2021",RE:[CASE 8248643921] Chat: 1/2 status failed,"April 21, 2021 10:01:54",4,shammi arti minute chime meeting meeting conversation yesterday removal package package operating netplan package removal capability package recovery yaml rule everything look oncall administration task scope assistance basis screen removal default backup change option backup

To summarize our discussion on the chat, you could not RDP to the following servers listed in the case even though you have launched a new ec2 instance and was trying to take an RDP to the following servers from another VPC but the connection failed. We have checked all the VPC's connection as you are utilizing transit gateway for interconnection between your VPC's. I see no issue with the transit gateway interconnection and you had already open a ticket with the vpc-tramsit gatrway team, and they confirmed no issue with the underlying VPC's interconnection.   Having done an RDP port 3389 test between the Servers this was not successful. Upon further checks we found out that the servers were configured with Symantec endpoint protection and the network configuration for Symantec endpoint protection was enabled on the servers. You do not have access to modify this configuration. I informed you that Symantec endpoint protection could cause the prevention from remotely accessing the servers and that you will have to modify the network firewall rule for this antivirus and test the connection again.   You will reach out to your internal administrator on this request and will check with the Symantec admin for further checks. As discussed I will leave the case open and do update us if you need any further information or help and we will be happy to assist you.   We value your feedback.

8267336221,One97 Communications Limited,Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2 - Linux),APAC,INDIA,simbarb,"Hi,  Thank you for your time on the chat.  Let me summarize what we discussed.  You had a GuardDuty finding ""UnauthorizedAccess:EC2/TorRelay"" for outbound access to IP address 217.155.40.118.  On the chat we checked on the running processes and current network connections to confirm if there was anything still connected to that IP and we did not find anything suspicious.  As discussed on the chat to review network connection there is need to log network traffic with tools like tcpdump on the instance at the OS level or VPC flow logs[1] at the network interface(ENI) level.  During the chat I confirmed that the domain pyro.eu.org has the IP address 217.155.40.118 and access to that domain, for example to a project like https://pyro.eu.org/projects/html2pdf, would trigger this finding as the IP address is also associated with the Tor network.  On the chat you confirmed that you will check with your team if there was any access to that domain or project.  If you confirm that there was access to this domain and you need to continue to access it, you can implement a suppression rule[2] based on the criteria - finding type ""UnauthorizedAccess:EC2/TorRelay"" and the remote IP address ""217.155.40.118"".   I trust this additional information is useful and please do reach out back on the case with your findings and we can continue with the investigation and troubleshooting if required.

8280704661,TataSky Ltd,Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2 - Linux),APAC,INDIA,psangav,"Hello Nasreen,  Sangavi from AWS Premium Support. I hope this email finds you well!  It was a pleasure talking to you and your colleague. This email is a summary of our discussion.  You reached out to us as the instances which was launched from an AMI shared from another account were getting immediately terminated upon launch, and you wanted to know the reason for the same.   I informed you that we do have a method to share the AMI with encrypted volumes to another account. A series of steps has to be followed for each and every AMI individually.  Below are the steps you would need to follow to do the same:   ======== In order to migrate an EC2 instance with encrypted EBS volumes to another account, please refer the following steps:  1) Create an AMI of the EC2 instance. 2) Create a copy of this AMI. While copying specify a custom KMS key in the Encryption option.  (The copy operation re-encrypts the existing data in EBS volumes (currently encrypted with default AWS Managed key) with a custom KMS key.) 3) Share the custom KMS key associated with the AMI with the target account.  4) Share the encrypted AMI with the target account.  5) In the context of the target account, locate the shared AMI and make a copy of it. While copying specify a custom KMS key of the target account.  6) Use the newly created copy to launch a new EC2 instance.  ========  Step 3 is the main step where we need to add your ARN ""arn:aws:iam::dest_acc_no5:user/C5284036"" in the key policy of the custom key in the source account. You can use the console to change a key policy document with the console's policy view.  Upon following the above steps you were able to launch an instance successfully. I hope this helps. As discussed I am marking the case as resolved. If you have further queries, please do get back to us and we will be more than happy to assist you.   Stay safe and have a great day ahead!

8280924981,PayU Payments Private Limited,Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2 - Linux),APAC,INDIA,krischai,"Hello Praveen,  Warm Greetings from AWS Premium Support. This is Chaitanya again. It was pleasure talking to you over the chat and screen share today. This summary email is a quick recap of the conversation we had on chat and screen share.  You have reached out to us as you are unable to attach the volume vol-0c816978677776856 to the instance i-0a1d876ca076cde53.  You have mentioned that the volume was attached 2 hours ago and was stuck in 'Attaching' state from then. So, I have checked from our internal tools and could see volume is 'in-use' however, the volume is still stuck in 'attaching'.  This happens when you specify a device name that's not in use by EC2, but is used by the block device driver within the EC2 instance, the attachment of the Amazon EBS volume fails. Instead, the EBS volume is stuck in the attaching state. This seems to be the reason why the volume might be stuck in attaching state. The corrective action for this is to force detach the volume and attach it again with a different device name.  So, we have went on a screen share and we could see it was attached as '/dev/sdf'. So, went ahead to force detach the volume since it is a new volume and attached back to the instance again this time with a different device name '/dev/sdp' and this time the volume was attached successfully to the instance.  For more on troubleshooting EBS volume stuck in attaching state, you can refer: https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/ebs-stuck-attaching/  I hope the session was helpful.

Herein is a summary of our chat:  - You reached out as you were concerned about applying KB and CVE patches to your Windows instances using SSM Patch Manager. - After going on screenshare I can confirm that the method you are using wherein you manually specify the patches is indeed correct to use Patch Manager to update non-critical patches or patches that are not in its inventory.  KB stands for knowledge base. These are issues identified by a KB number that are hotfixes directly associated with a Microsoft knowledge base article to fix a known issue with the OS.  CVE (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures) number is a unique identifier used by vendors such as Microsoft, RedHat, and Adobe to catalog individual vulnerabilities where patches are provided as a resolution.  For example, every page of a book has a unique number. This solves the problem of finding the information on the page quickly. CVE can either be OS level or hardware level. Those on the OS level (this will be determined by a quick google search of the CVE number) can be patched via Patch Manager (apologies for not mentioning this on the chat) however, the hardware level patches cannot as they would need to be updated on our end.  In the same way you specified the KBs to update, you can do so with the CVEs that are OS level.  You can view the successful patches in the Patch Manager console as well as by running the PowerShell command Get-Hotfix on the instance/s in question:  https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.management/get-hotfix?view=powershell-7.1  Apologies for the confusion here.

Please find below a brief summary of our chat.  You had contacted us as you wanted to know the root cause as to why the instance ""i-0998e649f1af22a5b"" was stopped at 2021-05-04 02:01 UTC -- 2021-05-04 07:31 IST.  On checking the instance from my end, I see that the instance was stopped in response to the scheduled retirement of the underlying hardware on which it was hosted on. The same posted in the Personal Health Dashboard (PHD) for the account '062484260092' on April 20, 2021 at 12:52:40 AM UTC+2 (April 20, 2021 at 16:22:40 AM IST). The event stated that the instance ""i-0998e649f1af22a5b"" will be stopped after '2021-05-04 02:00:00 UTC'. You can also the check the same from your end by:   Go to the Personal health Dashboard -> Event Log -> search for the Resource ID/ARN: i-0998e649f1af22a5b   As you know, hardware and networking equipment will never enjoy 100% uptime, and from time to time there are system failures. We make every commercially available effort to make sure Amazon Web Services is secure and resilient, giving you reliability and massive scale. However, hardware and network failures will inevitably occur in any environment.  To avoid prolonged downtime for an instance in future in case of a underlying host issue, I would highly recommend setting up Auto Recovery for your instances, which allows AWS to automatically perform a stop/start when an underlying hardware failure occurs. You can find more information in our documentation at [1] and [2], and the steps on how this can be achieved.  On behalf of AWS, I sincerely apologize for the inconvenience this issue has caused you. I hope the above information is useful.  As per your confirmation, I will be resolving this case from my end. If you have any other questions or concerns, I would request you to open a new case with us and we will be happy to assist you further.  Thank you.

You came through requesting increasing the volume size of your EBS disk.  I advised for normal extending volumes you can use the following AWS documentation:  Modify an EBS volume using Elastic Volumes (console)  -  https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/requesting-ebs-volume-modifications.html#modify-ebs-volume  Extend a Linux file system after resizing a volume  -  https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/recognize-expanded-volume-linux.html  You mentioned you are making use of Private Gluster instance. I mentioned there are different ways of achieving increasing the internal volume size. I mentioned it would would be best to reach out to a Gluster expert as this isnt support by AWS support. I have found some information that you may find helpful on extending the volume from third party documentation on Gluster instances:  Redhat Gluster FS Expanding Volumes https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_gluster_storage/3.4/html/administration_guide/expanding_volumes https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_gluster_storage/3.1/html/administration_guide/expanding_volumes  GlusterFS Storage Cluster on CentOS 7 https://wiki.centos.org/HowTos/GlusterFSonCentOS  Once this was provided you mentioned you will be taking over from hereon.

Is there any option to change the hostname during the creation process so we get a unique hostname every time a new instance is created from the AMI? I know I can change the hostname after the machine is up and running (through different scripts and/or rebooting) but I would prefer not to do this as we need to have the machine ready to go as quickly as possible. We are using these machines for Windows build nodes in AWS for our Jenkins system.   I see that there is an article on how to do this in Linux in AWS but I cannot seem to find anything for Windows. https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/set-hostname.html  Thanks, Jesse Instance ID(s):  Timestamp (YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS UTC):","May 11, 2021",Windows instances hostnames are always the same when cloned from an AMI,"May 11, 2021 18:11:53",4,hostname option hostname creation hostname hostname machine machine ready machine node jenkins article anything

Hope you are fine today,  It was my pleasure speaking with you regarding the reboot events for the instances:  - i-081c016b14485ab5e - i-05fe8fbb71d139040  I understood that the instances were down today at 06:55 AM UTC, and you would like to know what was the root cause of the issues.  I have started my investigations by checking the instances infrastructure, so I checked the CloudWatch metrics for the ""InstanceStatusCheck"" and the ""SystemStatusCheck"". I was able to confirm that there were no issues or any failure data points for these metrics, which is indicating that the underlying hardware was fine during that time frame.  Please check the CloudWatch metrics [1] [2] for more details about these metrics.  Said that, I have informed that the issue should be investigated on the level of the Operating System level, hence we went a head and analyzed the system logs and we saw that there was a ""yum update"" operation started at 06:48 AM just before the reboot events.  This led me to check if there was any patching operation that has been triggered from the ""Systems Manager"" service, and indeed I was able to see that there was a patch process started at the same time frame, here are the dertails:  - The document ""AWS-RunPatchBaseline"" has been triggered at 06:48 AM, it was using the following RunCommand ID ""d12f72b6-e844-47c0-b3c4-d7ef966bfb29"".  - Drilling down further, I was able to see that this RunCommand has been started based on the state manager association ""cb8763cf-d3da-4ca1-a7f6-60e6dcadd72b"" which is targeting all the instances in this region.  - Furthermore, the patch operation was having the option ""RebootIfNeeded"", which means that the SSM Agent will reboot the instance after the patch operation has been completed, which is now explaining why the instances rebooted during that time frame.  Moreover, you needed to know who scheduled that State Manager association or who triggered it.  ---> I have informed that the state manager association, will be triggered in the following scenarios:  ","May 13, 2021",RE:[CASE 8333827881] Primary Database - i-081c016b14485ab5e servers went down,"May 13, 2021 12:24:41",3,vignesh reboot investigation cloud watch point hardware cloud watch operating head operation reboot operation manager patch frame dertails document patch baseline run run manager association patch operation option reboot ssm agent patch operation manager association manager association scenario

Below I will provide a summary for our conversation.  You contacted us because you file '2021-03-31_01-00_databackup_3_1' was deleted from your EC2 instance 'i-0afa4e63db1bf8743' and you would like us to help get information about same.  Via our screen sharing session, you shared with me you did not find relevant message for deleting the file in messages log files, that was around 14-05-2021. We checked command history for root user (hdpmaster) using below commands:            - set date format for history commands using below command:          export HISTTIMEFORMAT=“%F %T""       - search for rm command in command history with below command:             history | grep rm            that showed rm command for file '2021-03-31_01-00_databackup_3_1', however tha was for couple of months ago.   We checked command history for ec2-user (default user), but we could see last modification time for ~ec2-user/.bash_history is old (last year) that make sense as you mentioned you do not use ec2-user for login to the instance.  Additionally, we checked if the file might be moved to another path using command `sudo find / -name '2021-03-31_01-00_databackup_3_1’ 2>/dev/null` but it return nothing. I checked instance details and I could not find EBS snapshots created for LVM volume mountpoint /backup.  As you know, per privacy and security concerns[1] AWS Premium Support Engineers have no visibility to running applications nor files exist inside EC2 instance for our customers, however I tried to help based on my best effort. I shared with you links[2,3] that could help with using xfs_undelete that tries to recover all files on an XFS filesystem marked as deleted. As best practise, I would recommend you to create instance AMI[4] or EBS snapshots[5] as a backup before install and work with xfs_undelete.  In order to tarck coming user activity, you can consider work with Auditd[6] service that collect and write log files of audit to the disk as a background service for ","May 17, 2021",RE:[CASE 8348254461] Chat: Query on how the data got deleted,"May 17, 2021 17:45:20",2,greeting conversation history date format history export search rm history history grep rm rm tha couple month history modification sense login path sudo nothing snapshot lvm mountpoint privacy concern engineer visibility effort filesystem practise snapshot backup install work order activity work collect audit disk background

We verified the missing libraries from working instance and they were part of OpenLdap package and ldd /usr/sbin/NetworkManager also shows that these libraries are required to bring up the many services.

8362588691,Grofers India Pvt. Ltd.,Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2 - Linux),APAC,INDIA,nondongm,"Hello,   Thank you for your patience with this investigation. I have checked the AWS infrastructure and found no issues that could have caused your instance to be unresponsive within the infrastructure as all the components were functioning correctly.  Looking at the instance, I see that it was failing  Instance Status Checks[1], instance status checks monitor the software and network configuration of your instance. These checks detect problems that require your involvement to repair. When an instance status check fails, typically you will need to address the issue yourself (for example, by rebooting the instance or by making changes on an operating system-level). If you're not familiar with the different instance status checks, please see the link labelled as [2] as the bottom of this correspondence.  Since this is an OS failure, we're not able to pin point the root cause but I can discuss possible reasons and provide guidance on how to investigate this issue within the instance as we don't have access to your OS due security a privacy concerns.  With that in mind, I looked  at the instance performance metrics, specifically  CPU_Utilization, NetworkIN,NetworkOut etc and all these were within the acceptable ranges for the instance. Looking at the EBS volumes attached to the instance, specifically the root volume(vol-04f49380 ), the volume breached both the 200 IOPS and 90 MB/s throughput limit for a standard volume[3] making the I/O operations to queue[4]. With a queue length of ~ 32,  latency is expected and I see it had spiked to over 90ms. What all of this tells us more than anything is that the volume was really under heavy utilization and not coping with the load. Looking at the screenshot, MySQL errors like ""Aborted connection ... Communication Packets""  are governed by the following timeout options:  -- interactive_timeout(https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/en/server-system-variables.html#sysvar_interactive_timeout)  net_read_timeout(https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/en/server-system-variables.html#sysvar_ne","May 20, 2021",RE:[CASE 8362588691] Unresponsive Instance on 2021-05-05 05:45:00AM UTC+5.30,"May 20, 2021 10:44:09",1,patience investigation infrastructure infrastructure component software problem involvement bottom guidance o privacy concern mind performance etc range iop limit operation length latency anything utilization load sql communication packet timeout option mysql

Here is the summary of our call: You reached out today as you were unable to access instance ""i-098ac682ec6a6503a"" via SSH.  Using internal tools, I checked the instance and noticed that instance had failed the system status checks [1]. The instance had a  scheduled event for June 03, 2021 but due to hardware failure underlying host got failed prior to scheduled event data. Our auto recovery software tried to recover the host but the hardware failure impaired the underlying host.  While on call, you performed a force stop/start to migrate the instance to new health underlying host. By doing this, instance was migrated to healthy host and you were able to access the instance via SSH.  Kindly accept our sincere apologies for any inconvenience caused by this encounter. When system issues of this nature occur, our dedicated Infrastructure teams thoroughly investigate the cause and architect system improvements.  I hope I was able to assist you.

It's my pleasure assisting you on this case today.  Please refer to the brief summary of our discussion.  You have contacted us that, after performing the package upgrade via the yum command, the instance not booting normal and failing the instance status check, there were around 8 machines had same issue which are launched from same base AMI.  To begin with, we have checked the console logs for the instance and noticed that instance entered into the emergency mode and reported failed to find the root and swap device. So, we have attached the volume to recovery instance and reverted the kernel to previous working kernel and booted the instance, however, the instance was failing with same error.  - https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/revert-stable-kernel-ec2-reboot/  Since the instance [i-071dee28150a78d15] was new and no application configured, you have replaced the root volume from working instance and we had performed the yum update again. Then, we confirmed the new initramfs (initramfs-4.18.0-305.el8.x86_64.img) was created and included the nvme and ena drivers. But, checking the yum update logs, we found the below error.  *********************  Line is not an assignment at '/etc/sysctl.d/99-sysctl.conf:11': (null) warning: %triggerin(systemd-239-45.el8.x86_64) scriptlet failed, exit status 1  Error in <unknown> scriptlet in rpm package systemd *********************  You had mentioned some custom configuration on the file /etc/sysctl.d/99-sysctl.conf, so we went ahead and removed those additional entries.  Then, checked /etc/default/grub file entries and noticed there were some additional GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX entries which referring to the swap and root device. So, we have reverted the entries by comparing with working instance launched from public AMI.  # cat /etc/default/grub GRUB_TIMEOUT=1 GRUB_DISTRIBUTOR=""$(sed 's, release .*$,,g' /etc/system-release)"" GRUB_DEFAULT=saved GRUB_DISABLE_SUBMENU=true GRUB_TERMINAL_OUTPUT=""c","May 25, 2021",RE:[CASE 8383002291] Chat: Not booting post upgrading Kernel patch,"May 25, 2021 11:32:47",2,rahul abhilash vediyappan refer discussion package yum machine base emergency mode swap device recovery kernel kernel yum update initramfs nvme ena driver yum line assignment scriptlet exit scriptlet package systemd custom conf entry entry entry swap device entry cat c

As discussed on the chat earlier, I could not find any detailed step by step guide from AWS on how to setup setup pcs cluster on RHEL 7/8 Linux instances. However, I managed to find the documentation from Red Hat that provide the step by step guide. I reached out internally in an attempt to see if I can find any information from our side that could satisfy your request. The answer I received were the same.  The guide I found from Red Hat include a chapter dedicated to setup of High Availability cluster on AWS. This is the closest I came to the official documentation. I?ve included the link to the Red Hat documentation in the reference section below.  Hopefully, the above information I have provided you with will be helpful.  Please feel free to get back to us if you have additional questions or concerns, and we will be happy to assist you further.

I see that you got disconnected from the chat and screenshare session. Please feel free to re-initiate a call or a chat. In the meantime, here is a summary of our chat and screenshare session.  You wanted to install Zabbix on your instances using an SSM document. For this, you can look at using one of these 2 things:     1. Using the AWS-RunShellScript document. Using Run Command and the AWS-RunShellScript document, you can run any command or script on an Amazon EC2 instance as if you were logged on locally. So you can put in your shell commands and they will run on the managed instance. The commands for installing Zabbix, will be under ""command parameters"" when running the run command. On the screenshare, we were following this doc here on Remotely Run Commands on an EC2 Instance[1] from ""Step 4. Run a Remote Shell Script"". OR     2. You can create a document and run it with Run Command, using the AWS console:         a) Here are the steps here[2]. For ""Document type"", you can select ""Command document"". Then on ""Content"", you can put in the contents of the .json or .yaml file.         b) Once the document is created, you can run the document using run commands[3]. For ""Command document"", you can select the document, you created in the Step a) above. Then run the document.  If you have any questions or need further assistance, please let me know. I will gladly look into it. Have a great day Shammi.

Please find a summary of our conversation along with troubleshooting steps  below:  You reached out to us as you had lost ssh key pair for the instance:i-04cfb958b81e75f6b.  We connected over chime and I guided you through steps to create a new keypair and connect using SSM session manager. We created and added IAM role for SSM to instance. We added keypair by using user data and verified later by detaching and attaching volume to a test instance. We then configured the instance with internet access and ran userdata again to install ssm agent. After connecting to the instance we verified keypair and restarted ssh service. After verifying multiple configurations we were still unable to login from centos user.  We analyzed the logs(tail -f /var/log/secure) and we could see some configuration restricting only ec2-user to connect. As the instance was using centos AMI, we created an ec2-user and added public key for the user along with sudo permissions. After that you were able to connect to instance using ec2-user.   You informed that you were connecting to the instance using PAM, we suggested you to reach out to your system admin to check PAM configuration which were causing issues. Please note that as AWS EC2 engineers we do not have expertise in PAM. Additionally, due to strict data privacy policies we do not have access inside customer instances and hence we cannot comment on os configurations etc. I hope you understand our limitations here.  I am attaching the detailed steps which we followed below for your reference:   Note-: Before proceeding please make sure you have adequate backups(AMI) of the instance.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- A:  Create an IAM Role(You can skip this step as we had already created IAM role, you can use the same role for other instances) :  1. Open the IAM console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/.     2. In the navigation pane, choose Roles, and then choose Create role.

You were concerned about yourEC2 Instance ""i-0809bb6af96a29353"" to be giving 'Connection timed out' error while SSHing via PuTTY. The source machine is an EC2 Instance launched in a Private Subnet, and have NAT Gateway configured.   For testing purposes, we added an Inbound Rule in the SecurityGroup ""sg-05676d9d8b685c9cc"" to allow all traffic '0.0.0.0/0' on port 22, which proved useful, and you were able to connect. The resolution is, to add the Public IP of the NAT Gateway to the Ingress rules of the destination EC2 Instance's Security Group on port 22.  NOTE: as a security best practice, please remove the (0.0.0.0/0) rule on port 22, and only allow the Public IP addresses of the trusted sources you shall be connecting from.   I am glad my assistance proved useful you you. I shall mark this case as resolved for now. Should you have any other queries or concerns, please feel free to reach us back.

This suggests that your ubuntu instance is unable to fetch the package file, libcurl3_7.52.1-5+deb9u13_amd64.deb as it is unable to find the network location where it was supposed to be present.  This can either mean that the .deb update file is no longer present in that location or the baseURL for your updates repository is not configured correctly. May I have the instance-id of your ubuntu instance where you are getting this error to check the AMI you are using?

Thank you for providing the EC2Rescue logs as requested.   From my investigation into the logs provided, I first looked into the Application logs in order to examine the reason for the RDP failures, which was the issue you created this case to investigate. Following the Application logs, I was able to see the following errors, which appear in sequence throughout the logs:  Error 31/05/2021 22:53:33 Winlogon 4005 None Error 31/05/2021 22:53:33 SideBySide 33 None Error 31/05/2021 22:53:31 SideBySide 33 None  It would appear that the Winlogon 4005 errors are being preceded by the SideBySide errors with the error code 33. Research into this error code shows that it is related to missing or corrupt components on the OS level within the Microsoft Visual C++ 2005 redistributable, as seen within the following documentation [1]. It also appears that this error message is responsible for the RDP issues that you have been experiencing.   Further investigation into this issue shows that Symantec software appears to be unable to launch due to the Side By Side error as well.   Error 31/05/2021 09:21:33 Service Control Manager 7000 None The Symantec Endpoint Protection Scan Service service failed to start due to the following error:  The application has failed to start because its side-by-side configuration is incorrect.  The documentation referenced above also references Symantec Mail Security for Microsoft Exchange as a possible cause of this issue, therefore, I would kindly ask whether any Symantec software was installed on the instance that may have caused this issue?  As RDP access is currently not possible, and other methods of accessing the OS of the instance have also failed, the ability to further investigate this issue is not possible, however, as summarised above, the root cause appears to be an OS level issue (SideBySide) that may have been caused by the installation of Symantec software.

Please find below a brief summary of same :  Ask: ======  Can you use volume while it is in optimizing state post extension of volume   Discussion on chat : ======================  1. You mentioned that you have extended volume from 500 GB to 1500 GB and are able to see the space on instance OS as expected . On EBS volume level you see that it is optimizing so can you use it or should you wait . 2. I explained to you that you can definitely use the volume as optimization is a backend process and does not stop you from using the volume. The only thing to keep in mind is while the volume is in the optimizing state, your volume performance is in between the source and target configuration specifications. Transitional volume performance will be no less than the source volume performance. Ref: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/WindowsGuide/monitoring-volume-modifications.html  3. You mentioned that you want to move 800GB of data to it , I explained to you that you should probably do it in smaller chunks with one move at a time so as disk doesn?t get overwhelmed with extensive IOs.

Please find a brief summary of our discussion below:  You reached out to us as you were unable to change instance type of the instance: i-0a6c28666d1c98a02 from m4 to m5/m5a. I informed you that this instance is launched from AMI: ami-cec5afa1 whose source AMI is: ami-9b1c76f4 and ami-9b1c76f4 is marketplace centOS AMI. According to the link: https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pp/prodview-gkh3rqhqbgzme?qid=1623244118262&sr=0-1&ref_=srh_res_product_title , this AMI does not support m5/m5a instance type and this is the reason you are unable to switch to these instance types. Unfortunately, there is no workaround for this as the vendors (here CentOS.org) decide the supported instance types for their products and we have no control over it.

You were seeing a signature mismatch were with the IAM attachment to the EC2 instance whenever you would execute an API Call.

I also suggested to use the ""Maintenance Windows"" to schedule the patching operation automatically, However since your use case doesn't require that as you don't have a specific window time for the patching operation, we skipped that suggestion.

You contacted us as you observed when you try to login to one of your EC2 instance with your domain user it logged and the profile name is showing as username.domainname.   We reviewed the details over screen share and we can see that there are 2 profiles created for user (svcrpastudio and svcrpastudio.ANT). You had dependency on the profile svcrpastudio as few applications packages are tied to that user folder. We discussed the possible causes[1] and based on discussion I understand that there might be local user with the same name earlier but now we don?t have any local user with that username. So we logged in with the local admin account and renamed the profile to svcrpastudio.ANT.old and we updated the registry key(HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\ProfileList\<SID>) associated with this user to point the profile image path to svcrpastudio. After that you were able to login to the server using old profile and your application worked as expected with this user.   I hope you find this information useful.

8451819081,Compass Group Holdings PLC,Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2 - Linux),APAC,INDIA,isiaho,"Good day,  Harun here from AWS Premium Support. It was a pleasure talking to you today.   To recap our conversation, you reached out to us because you wanted to know if your Amazon Linux instance will be providing extended support.  The standard support for Amazon Linux ended as of December 31, 2020. Beginning January 1, 2021, the Amazon Linux AMI entered a new maintenance support period that extends to June 30, 2023. The updates provided will be only for critical and important security fixes that apply to a reduced set of packages. Additionally, some packages in the AMI and its repositories will slowly be deprecated throughout the maintenance support period according to their upstream end-of-life practices.  AWS will provide critical and important security updates to the Linux kernel in the AMI, as well as all but the deprecated userspace packages. This means that AWS will only provide support for kernel and userspace packages that are not deprecated. For more information and the list of packages that were deprecated, visit the FAQ link below;   - https://aws.amazon.com/amazon-linux-ami/faqs/  You also wanted to know if RHEL 6.10 is still supported. Maintenance support for RHEL 6.10 ended on 30 November 2020. RHEL 6 has Extended life cycle support which ends on 30 June 2024. Below is the official communication regarding RHEL 6 support  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Customers running Red Hat Enterprise 6 should be aware that on November 30, 2020, all Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6-based products will transition from the Maintenance Phase to the Extended Life Phase. For customers running Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 on-demand instances on Amazon EC2, a standard server subscription is included and cannot be extended to include the extended lifecycle support  or other add-on subscriptions. The standard subscription provided for all on-demand instances entitles AWS customers to run any version of RHEL, but for customers who require the Extended Lifecycle Support a","Jun 11, 2021",RE:[CASE 8451819081] Call: End of Life support,"June 11, 2021 11:15:22",4,conversation december maintenance period update fix set package package repository maintenance period practice update kernel userspace package kernel userspace package list package faq rhel maintenance rhel rhel life cycle june communication hat enterprise product maintenance phase life phase hat enterprise subscription lifecycle subscription subscription rhel lifecycle

Please find a brief summary of our discussion  below:  You reached out to us as you are unable to launch instances using IAM role: tis-l3-role and are getting Unauthorized error. I informed you that to troubleshoot the issue we need to decode the error message and for that we need aws-cli: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/sts/decode-authorization-message.html and https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/aws-backup-encoded-authorization-failure/ .   I also informed you that SCP is enabled for your organization which may be causing the issue. Hence, I requested you to login to your account: 307455894664 using your IAM user and disable the SCP. You were facing some issue while logging in using IAM users and mentioned that you will check this with your team.  I also created a test IAM user in my test account with exact same IAM policies as  tis-l3-role and was able to launch an instance in my account successfully. Hence, I suspect that the issue can be with SCP only. Please try to launch an instance after disabling SCP one and please feel free to re-initiate if you continue to face the issue: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/organizations/latest/userguide/orgs_manage_policies_enable-disable.html  I hope the above information helps.

You are getting the below timeout message:  ""A connection timeout has occurred on a previously established connection to availability replica 'PBSQL-PROD-SEC2' with id [DC3B7E14-44B5-4285-99DD-2979F1BD8146].  Either a networking or a firewall issue exists or the availability replica has transitioned to the resolving role""  While on the call and on the screen share to investigate this issue, we needed to check the ENA driver version which was up to date and the AWS PV driver version which was version 8.3.3 which was quite old version. The latest version for the AWS PV driver is 8.4.0. I advise to update the AWS PV driver version to the latest version as this will help with the following:  --Stability fixes to address rare cases of stuck disk IO.  --Stability fixes to address rare cases of crashes during EBS volume detachment.  --Added feature to distribute load across multiple cores for workloads that leverage more than 20,000 IOPS and experience degradation due to bottlenecks. To enable this feature, see Workloads that leverage more than 20,000 disk IOPS experience degradation due to CPU bottlenecks.  From the backend I have checked on the network communication traffic and no issue found with traffic or data drops. The next step was to investigate on the timeout on the Always On SQL and I found similar issue and the exact timeout message you are getting on your SQL server cluster which was a known issue to Microsoft. According to Microsoft this problem occurs because of an internal race condition.

Thank you for your time over the chat today, it was a pleasure assisting you.  Below you'll find a short summary of our conversation:  You reached out as you wanted an assistance in backing up your Instance from the Singapore region to Mumbai region.  Upon our conversation, we discussed the following:  - You can create an AMI of the instance and copy this AMI from the current region to Mumbai region and can launch an instance out of this AMI. Please refer the below link for more information on this:  # https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/copy-ami-region/  - Alternatively, you can create a snapshot of the volume that you want to move and then copy this snapshot from the current region to Mumbai region, create a volume of this snapshot and attach it to any instance in the mumbai region.  # https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ebs-copy-snapshot.html  Moving further, we also discussed about the instance store volumes and you can refer below links for more information on this:  # https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/InstanceStorage.html # https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/ec2-linux-instance-store-volumes/  Additionally, you also wanted to know how to make regular cross region backups for your instances, to which we discussed you can do it using AWS Backups.

8474307111,Dream11 Fantasy Private Limited,Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2 - Linux),APAC,INDIA,thwomp,"Hello,  Greetings from AWS Support! My name is Josh, and I will be assisting you today. I understand you would like to know if it is possible to enforce a policy where EC2 instances must be launched with specific tags.   This behavior is possible!  There are at least two options to configure this behavior, with varying levels of automation. First, you can create an IAM policy that only allows the RunInstances action if particular tags and key values are present. This means when a user launches a new EC2 instance they must launch it with specific tags, or else the instance launch will fail. There is another option to accomplish similar behavior, and it involves using a Lambda function to detect instance launches and dynamically update their tags. The process is somewhat involved, and requires creating a CloudTrail trail, SSM Parameter Store parameters, IAM policies, and a Lambda function. The tutorial can be found here [1]. Below I am going to further explain the procedures for option 1, as option 2 has a very specific set of instructions to follow already in the document, and includes customizing Python code.  Please reference the following article [2]. The document I have included below has an entire policy in JSON format that enforces this behavior [2]. The piece of the policy that implements the requirement for particular tags is below:  ""Condition"": {         ""StringEquals"": {           ""aws:RequestTag/key1"": ""value1"",           ""aws:RequestTag/key2"": ""value2""         },         ""ForAllValues:StringEquals"": {           ""aws:TagKeys"": [             ""key1"",             ""key2""           ]  In your policy, you can edit the “key” and “value” values to be whatever tags you like. To create an IAM policy for requiring instances to launch with tags, copy the JSON document in the second link I provided [2], and paste it into the JSON tab of the Create policy menu in the IAM console. Instructions for creating an IAM policy via the console can be found here [3]. Once the policy has been created, you can attach it to an ","Jun 17, 2021",RE:[CASE 8474307111] Regarding the EC2 Instance launch,"June 17, 2021 22:07:03",4,greeting policy tag behavior option behavior automation iam policy run tag tag launch option behavior function launch tag cloud trail ssm parameter store parameter policy function tutorial procedure option option set instruction document python code article document policy json format piece policy requirement tag condition string equal equal key policy key iam policy tag json document json tab create policy menu instruction iam policy policy

My name is Andres and I will be assisting you with your case today.   From your correspondence, I understand that (AIRVTRAWSVTRAVEL-APP / i-08346b19797bd22a2) failed reachability check at 2021/06/07 and you would like assistance getting this instance back up.  After my investigation, I can see that on 2021-06-22 15:32 UTC, the instance experienced a temporary Instance Status check failure as it is now reporting healthy. Also, I reviewed the underlying AWS hardware and can confirm there was no issue on any of the AWS infrastructure the instance is running on as well no System Status check. More so, further review on the CPU usage and there were no major usage spikes within the time of instance status check failure.  An instance status check failure usually indicates a problem with the instance in scope, such as:  • Networking or startup configuration issues • Exhausted memory • File system issues • Failure to boot the operating system • Failure to mount volumes correctly • Incompatible drivers    Checking the instance most recent console logs, I can confirm that the instance experienced memory constraints as there are several ""Out of Memory"" errors. This is likely the root cause of the issue. A soft reboot may be helpful in the interim to get this instance back up.   --- [6711017.677548] Out of memory: Kill process 10954 (ds_am) score 14 or sacrifice child ---  In terms of knowing what processes are responsible for hogging up all your system memory, you can use OS level monitoring tools.

As discussed, below is a quick recap of the conversation we had over the chat today.   Issue: ******* Unable to execute AWS CLI commands as it fails with below error message. Error: ""failed to create process""   Summary: ************ Over the chat session you mentioned that you are unable to execute the AWS CLI commands over the instance. No matter what AWS commands you run, it throws the above error.  We then connected over the screen share session and tried the below steps to troubleshoot the issue.  Steps Tried: -------------   - As you were using an old msi file, we downloaded the new msi [1] and re-installed the CLI but still the same error.   - Tried running the 'aws configure' command, same error.   - Tried the commands from an admin cmd window, same error.   - Tried running 'aws --version', same error.   - Uninstalled the AWS CLI and re-installed it but still the same issue.   - Tried uninstalling the AWS CLI, restarting the server, ran 'where /R c:\ aws' command to make sure that no CLI files are there, then again installed the app but no difference.   - Removed the environment variable and re-added it again, still no difference.   - Tried installing the CLI from a different user but no luck.   Finally we followed the below steps and resolved the issue.   Resolution Steps: ******************** • Installed the AWS CLI to D:\ location instaed of C:\Program Files and once the installation went through,  the 'aws configure' command started working successfully.  • You were also able to use the S3 commands without any issue now.  We discussed, that since the machine is joined to an Active directory, there could be restricted permissions provided over the C: drive due to which the issue was occurring and got resolved when we selected the D:\ for installation.   As per the discussion, I will be proceeding closure of the case for now. However, Please feel free to reach back to me, in case any further assistance is required over the same.","Jun 24, 2021",RE:[CASE 8502893401] Chat: Unable to run aws s3 commands,"June 24, 2021 12:54:04",4,recap conversation cli cli matter msi msi cli configure admin cmd cli cli c cli app difference environment variable difference cli resolution cli location instaed installation configure machine directory permission drive d installation discussion closure assistance

You have contacted us in regards to the SSH issue you were facing on instance 'i-0b8e6d0b9144095a1'. During our screenshare session we were able to resolve the issue and confirmed that you are able to SSH into the instance using your sftp users as well as default user. For the past few days, I was trying to understand the exact cause of issue that is hindering the access to the instance via SSH. I shall walk you through my findings as well as the analysis we made during the screenshare session. Kindly excuse the length of this response as I need to convey all the information in detail.  Summary of the Issue ====================  Your instance 'i-0b8e6d0b9144095a1' was working fine with SSH till last Friday (2nd July) and later from Monday onward you noticed that your different users are denied with access to the instance. The instance is using a custom port 6239 for SSH and you have created different user logins for your SFTP server. As a part of fix, you even tried to change the instance type, however this was not working. As per the system log, the network manager on the instance side seems down and you had an assumption that this could be related, hence during our initial analysis we checked the issue with network on the server side. Later we were able to understand that network.manager service has nothing do with the ssh issue as the network interface is up and running for the instance. The SSH attempts were performed from a bastion host which has active connections to the instance. Deploying a similar instance from the same AMI showed the same behavior. So in short we were able to narrow down that the issue is specific to SSH service in the instance.  Initially we tried to troubleshoot and fix via screenshare and AMI sharing, but unfortunately your encrypted AMI was not getting launched on my end. Hence we decided on a live troubleshooting which helped us to fix the issue.

8546116151,Edelweiss Financial Services Ltd,Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2 - Linux),APAC,INDIA,leonjosh,"Hello,  Josh here once more, thank you for your time on the call and screenshare today.   It was a pleasure working with you, I'm glad that we were able to restore the logs on the instance  i-0ad740887165c27a6.  I understand that on the third of this month you had updated certain packages including the rsyslog package. We used strace to confirm that the service was not throwing any unexpected errors and were able to see that rsyslog was running, the permission for the files and directories looked to be correct as well. We further reviewed the selinux status and saw it was disabled.  We used 'logger' to try and push logs to the /var/log/messages file but found that we could not induce entries to the file. We then changed the option to OmitLocalLogging to off from on as it was as per below  in the /etc/rsyslog.conf file and restarted the rsyslog service.  ------------------------------------ # Turn off message reception via local log socket; # local messages are retrieved through imjournal now. $OmitLocalLogging on ------------------------------------  After  this we confirmed that you were seeing entries in the messages file and logger worked once more to test the log entries, we then ssh'd in once more and saw secure update. You also noted that the crontab entries logs were not populating, after testing and inducing crontabs you then saw the logs being pushed to cron and crontab once more.

This is Aamir who got your chat earlier today. Unfortunately we could not proceed on chat, therefore, I’m sending this correspondence as I checked your query.  I’m aware about the concern that you created an HVR instance from Marketplace but you cannot find the instance in EC2 console. As per the attached screenshot, it appears that the Marketplace subscription may take some time to complete and only after the instance can be launched. Hence, the instance may not be created until you are subscribed to the AMI and the subscription is complete. Furthermore, I checked your CloudTrail history for past hour and I could not see an instance created apart from some instances launched by Auto Scaling service. Thus, I’d suggest you to wait for an hour until the subscription is complete and then check if the instance is created and you are able to locate in EC2 console.  I hope this is helpful. However, in case you do not find the instance in the console after an hour or you receive an email mentioning that the subscription was unsuccessful, please feel free to reach me back via this case and I’ll be happy to assist you further.

It was nice working with you. I am following up regarding our discussion earlier.  To summarize, you had an instance i-09ec632a6120702cd failing reachability checks. I had a look at the instance.   I can see that the system status checks are healthy which means that the underlying hardware where your instance is running is healthy. Only the instance status checks are failing which is an indication of a problem inside the instance at the OS layer. Please note that we do not have visibility inside the instance for security and confidentiality reasons. Some typical reasons for instance status checks failures are resource exhaustion, broken network or startup configuration, kernel issues, or filesystem/device problems. For more information about EC2 status checks, please refer to this link [1].  To look at the system status checks metric, please refer to this link [2]. To look at the instance status checks metric, please refer to this link [3].  I checked the instance history and I can see it was launched about 2 hours ago. The instance never passed any status checks since it was launched. This means that the problem is in the AMI itself. You would need to fix those problems in the AMI first and then launch an instance from it. However, you mentioned that the instance that this AMI was created from was also already terminated. You mentioned you would be trying to launch another instance from a public Amazon Linux 2 AMI instead. If you need any data from this instance, you can simply attach the root volume to your new instance and copy the data over.  As discussed, I am going to mark this case as resolved. However, please feel free to reach out again in case of any other questions or concerns.

You reached out to us with an issue that the files stored on the /tmp directory were missing when you started the server and those files were available before you Stopped the server and you would like to know how the files got removed.   During the chat, we discussed that any data stored on the /tmp directory will get removed automatically one you rebooted OR stopped the server.  You can also check the same via below link --  https://stackoverflow.com/questions/27049216/linux-tmp-folder-how-to-know-if-files-will-deleted-after-reboot-or-after-some  Just for the verification, I have also launched a fresh Ubuntu 16.04 instance and created some dummy files in /tmp directly and then I rebooted the server and as expected, files were deleted when server boots again.   We also, tried the possibility of recovering the file from the snapshot but you mentioned that concerned file was not on the instance at the time when snapshot was created.   As discussed I am marking this case as ""Closed"". If you have any other queries or concerns, feel free to open up a new case, I would be happy to assist.   Thank You and Have a Great Day!

8574357281,Ibibo Group,Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2 - Windows),APAC,INDIA,yoliswa,"Hello Vaibhav,   It was a pleasure working with you, on chat. You reached out today, as you do not have the .pem key file used to encrypt the administrator password for the EC2 instance i-0acee79480715274b and you requested assistance in this regard.   Whenever the key pair used to launch a Windows instance is lost, the key pair needs to be replaced. To do this, there are two options, namely using SSM or performing the steps manually as illustrated in the article below:  [+] https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/ec2-windows-replace-lost-key-pair/  I have looked at i-0acee79480715274b and see that is a managed instance in the SSM console. So if you were to manually go through the process, this is how I would do it:  1. Connect to i-0acee79480715274b using a SSM Session Manager session from the console [1]. 2. Reset the local administrator password by running this command:  net user administrator <newAdminPassword> 3. RDP to i-0acee79480715274b using the administrator username with the new password specified in Step 2 4. Once connected, you can configure the Administrator password to be regenerated and encrypted by EC2Config [2]:  a) Open the XML file at the file path - \Program Files\Amazon\Ec2ConfigService\Settings\config.xml  b) At the top of the file, find the plugin with the name Ec2SetPassword and change the state from Disabled to Enabled and save the file. 5. Stop the instance and create an image of it [3]. 6. Once the AMI is available, launch an instance from the AMI created in Step 5. For Select a key pair, choose a key pair you do have access to. 7. Once this new instance is up and running, you can disassociate 13.229.187.44 from i-0acee79480715274b [4] and associate it to the instance launched from Step 6 [5].

8583738611,HDFC Life Insurance Company Limited,Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2 - Linux),APAC,INDIA,tahriqh,"Hello Brijesh,  Tahriqh here again, thanks for your time earlier it was nice working with you.  You reached out for some assistance with setting up notifications for your EC2 Spot Fleet instance expiration.  I've informed you that EC2 sends a spot instance interruption notice two minutes before Amazon EC2 stops or terminates your Spot Instance. Also, if you specify hibernation as the interruption behavior, you will receive an interruption notice, but you do not receive a two-minute warning - this is due to the hibernation process beginning immediately. More information on this can be found here [1].  These notices are made available as CloudWatch events and as such, you are able to setup an event rule to publish the data to an SNS Topic or Lambda function. You can then subscribe to the topic to receive notifications when data is published to that topic or function - in your case, you have a requirement to subscribe via a Slack Channel.  During our chat, we joined a screenshare session where I assisted you with this, below are the steps we performed:  1. First we planned to create a new SNS topic but you had decided you will use an existing one that sends notifications to a Slack Channel via a Lambda function:  Lambda function: SNSToSlackAlert  SNS Topic: atom-prod-alerts  2. Next, we created an Amazon EventBridge [2] rule to publish notifications to the SNS Topic mentioned above:  First create a new rule by specifying a pre-defined pattern and selecting the AWS service 'EC2 Spot Fleet'. For Event Type, you selected 'All Events'.  For the target, you select the SNS Topic 'atom-prod-alerts' (you can also specify the Lambda function directly here).  With this, we have configured CloudWatch to send notifications to the SNS Topic 'atom-prod-alerts' which is subscribed to by the Lambda function 'SNSToSlackAlert'.  You mentioned that you plan to continue testing in your own capacity since you had other commitments at the end of our chat.

Thank you very much for your time on the chat and meeting. It was a pleasure working with you today. I'm sending this correspondence as a recap of the conversation.  You reached out as you wanted to upgrade the nginx version from 1.19.0 to 1.21.1 on you production instances. You informed me that you are currently running the nginx version provided by the nginx-plus running on the nginx-plus AMI ami-06464f03793fbccb5.  While performing the relvant troubleshooting, we noticed that the latest version of nginx-plus is nginx-plus-24-2.amzn2.ngx.x86_64. After installing this version on a test instance, we checked the nginx version receiving the following output:      # nginx -v     # nginx version: nginx/1.19.10 (nginx-plus-r24-p1)  This imply that the nginx/1.19.10 is the latest version provided by the nginx-plus is nginx-plus-24-2.amzn2.ngx.x86_64 (that is the latest nginx plus version) and this nginx version is the same that is running on the production instances (that are running the nginx-plus-22 version).  According to this, we tried to force the upgrade of the nginx only through the nginx repo provided by the Amazon-Linux-Extra. The version provided by this is the 1.20 that should fix the vulnerability.

It was nice talking to you today, and here I would like to share the summary of the same.  You've faced 1/2 status check failure for EC2 Instance i-074cf2ab9b2b0a40e and i-00ef2be20349ed3c1, which you resolved by restarting these Instance. However, you needed to know the reason and resolution for the same.   Using our Internal tools, I investigated these instance and was able to see that the Instance i-074cf2ab9b2b0a40e was failing Instance status checks from July 16, 07:38 to 08:40 UTC. Also, the Instance i-00ef2be20349ed3c1 was failing Instance status checks from July 16, 06:36 to 08:35 UTC, which is evident from the graphs [1][2]. Kindly note that there can be many reasons for these Instance status check failures, following are examples of problems that can cause instance status checks to fail:  * Failed system status checks due to issue with Underlying hardware on which Instance is running * Incorrect networking or startup configuration * Exhausted memory * Corrupted file system * Incompatible kernel  I investigated the underlying hardware on which these instances were running during the time of this issue, but couldn't find anything out of ordinary with them, which is evident from the graph [3][4]. To know more about status check failures please refer the link https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/monitoring-system-instance-status-check.html  Upon check the CPU Utilization for these Instance, I could see that CPU Utilization had spiked to higher value around the time of issue for both the Instances, which is evident from the graphs [5][6]. Please note that, in virtualization, various vCPUs share the underlying hardware. To manage the resources amongst them, a baseline is set for each vCPU and they are allowed to use the resources based on their baseline. Amazon T3 Standard instances provide a baseline level of CPU performance with the ability to burst above that baseline level.

You were experiencing issues launching m4 and c4 instance types in ap-south-1c receiving the error that the instance types are not available in that AZ. You could also not launch the AMI as a c5, m5 or t3 instance type in ap-south-1c and wanted to know what your alternatives are.  Unfortunately, the c4, m4 and t2 instance types are not available in ap-south-1c, which we confirmed by checking on the console or running the describe-instance-type-offerings AWS CLI command as below: aws ec2 describe-instance-type-offerings --location-type availability-zone  --filters Name=instance-type,Values=Instance_type_and_size  --region ap-south-1 --output table  I reached out to an EC2 expert and the most likely reason that you cannot select the new generation instance types (c5, m5, t3 etc.) is due to the image selected not supporting ENA. You can check your image for ENA support with the command: aws ec2 describe-images --region $REGION_ID --image-ids AMI_ID --query ""Images[].EnaSupport""  In order to enable ENA on your AMI please follow the instructions on this documentation [1]. In order to run on the new generation instance types you may also need to check the storage drivers as well [2].  If you would like to learn more about configuring the AWS CLI please see the following documentation [3]. Please follow the steps above and try launching your AMI on a c5, m5 or t3 instance in ap-south-1c, if you still experience issue please reach out to us for further assistance.

To recap our conversation you reached out to us because the EC2 instance 'i-05a0fe5794df73345' was failing instance status checks.  We reviewed the instance and noticed it was failing to mount some mount points in '/efc/fstab'. We detached the root volume and attached it to a rescue instance. We commented out the entry for EFS and re-attached the volume to the affected instance.  We were able to successfully start and access the instance. We then tried to mount the EFS filesystem again but we were still getting an error. Upon mounting the EFS file system using the mount command, it was mounted successfully.  We reviewed the fstab entry and noticed the entry was as below   $ fs-1b1653ca:/ /efs efs defaults, _netdev 0 0   We updated the entry to the following and upon mounting it worked.   $ $ fs-1b1653ca:/ /efs efs defaults,_netdev 0 0   We also tested this by rebooting the instance and confirmed it worked.

You reached out because of the issues you’ve experienced facing issue while connecting to a DB via Lambda and as per DB and Lambda AWS engineer, it was suspected that the problem could be with the ec2 instance network.  While connected on Webex meeting together with engineers from Lambda and DB, we looked into the EC2 instance metrics to establish if there has been any changes to the performance or network problem on the EC2 instance or the underlying hardware.   The metrics reviewed included CPU utilization[1], NetworkIn[2] and NetworkOut[3]. None of these metrics indicated that there is any problem on the instance, as mentioned, the metrics show the same pattern for the past 2 weeks with very few spikes. The same was observed from the underlying hardware, I could not find any problem that could affect the connection to the database hosted in the instance. I also checked the Volumes on the instance to make sure that there was no issues from there as well.  From the console logs, there was nothing alarming that I observed, the one thing that stood out was the use of Trend DSA which was flagged as a common cause of performance, network and stability issues. However, after removing the ds_agent from the instance, there was not much improvement. This led to the conclusion that networking from from the instance is not causing this problem.   It was discussed that this will be looked at from the Application/DB level and communicate with the relevant department on our side if the need arise.  As discussed on the call, I’ve included the links to the instance metrics in the reference section below for your convenience.  Hopefully, the above information I have provided you with will be helpful.  Please feel free to get back to us if you have additional questions or concerns and we will be happy to assist you further.

8613247091,Ibibo Group,Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2 - Linux),APAC,INDIA,donough,"Hi,  Thank you for coming on call with me today.  In summary we have discussed the networking of all 8 instances you have provided.  We concluded that I saw nothing from the AWS side that could’ve caused the networking of being affected. We reviewed some of the instances that you mentioned that had very high networking bytes and discussed there are some spikes but there hasn’t been any for a consistent period of time, which indicates no limits are reached as mentioned over a call. I mentioned when the issue happens again, you should reach out immediately.  You will see from the documentation for example: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/viewing_metrics_with_cloudwatch.html  NetworkIn  The number of bytes received by the instance on all network interfaces. This metric identifies the volume of incoming network traffic to a single instance.  The number reported is the number of bytes received during the period. If you are using basic (five-minute) monitoring and the statistic is Sum, you can divide this number by 300 to find Bytes/second. If you have detailed (one-minute) monitoring and the statistic is Sum, divide it by 60.   For the instance: i-00f73b7951792b6d4:  I have calculated the highest network bandwidth between 2021-07-21T01:00 UTC and 2021-07-21T08:00 UTC of data coming in and and as you will see from what we have discussed it below any throttling amount. We confirmed we aren’t able to see any throttling from our end as well.  22040315978/300 = 73467719.9267 *8 = 587741759.413 bps = 587.741759413Mbps  I have found an article posted by AWS which would help with network performance. Amazon EC2 has recently announced additional high-resolution instance level network performance metrics for Elastic Network Adapter (ENA), with these new metrics you can gain insights into traffic drops when network allowances are exceeded.

8631901681,Solutions Infini Technologies (India) Private Limited,Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2 - Linux),APAC,INDIA,shrmrp,"Hello Anu,  Thank you for your patience.  As per the update from the internal service team, there were no issues with the underlying host during the time the instance CPU spiked, so to summarize the issue seems to have been triggered at the OS level itself. Also, if we see the number of processes that were running that time, there are 900+ processes initiated by Apache, so there is a possibility of Apache user ulimit being hit which is a configuration at the OS level and since the instance is terminated we cannot check those limits. Since the issue at host end has been isolated, the investigation further would require an access to the OS logs such as /var/log/messages and /var/log/dmesg and unfortunately we do not have this data available. The graphs that you shared were helpful in reaching out on a conclusion that there was high load average including the memory unavailability on the instance at that time which points that the root cause seems to be some culprit process hogging the server resources or some limits being hit at the OS level. As discussed on the call, I would suggest you to have the ""ATOP"" tool configured on the OS for a better analysis of the server resources and the processes running on it.   For more details on the tool here:  https://www.tecmint.com/how-to-install-atop-to-monitor-logging-activity-of-linux-system-processes/  Unfortunately, we are unable to dive deep for further investigation due to lack of OS logs and instance being terminated as of now. I completely understand that this might not be the exact response that you were looking for and we are really sorry for the same, however in such scenarios when there is no issue at the host/hardware level, we cannot provide an RCA and in this case the situation is a little different as well considering the instance is no longer available.  I hope you understand our limitations here and in case you want to discuss anything, please feel free to update the case and we can schedule a call.  Have a great day ahead!  We value your feedback.

Your instance experienced issues around 23rd July 2021 between 06:23 IST - 06:28 IST(00:53 - 00:58 UTC) and you could see a dip in network activity at the time fro the supplied graph.  On the chat I checked on the instance and the underlying hardware during that time frame, and the instance and underlying host did not experience any network related issues and they were both reachable and passing status checks with no issues logged at the time.  I also checked on the EBS volumes and all of them had average single digit latencies and were not breaching any IOPS or throughput limits.  There was however minimal activity during the timeframe indicating the application was not performing much IO at that time.  To investigate the issue further I recommended reviewing the instance OS and application logs to see what was logged at the time and also review any resource usage like memory which is not graphed via CloudWatch.   You confirmed that there was a query you were running at the time and you will go ahead and try to reproduce the issue in your PT environment.  You indicated you already had sar installed, and I also recommend installing atop[1], if you do not already have it installed.  These tools will help provide additional metrics to review during the reproduction.  With these tools you can be able to review historical metrics for the memory, CPU, I/O, networking as reported from within the instance and a historical perspective of the running processes at the time.  The additional log information from these tools will be very useful to troubleshoot and identify any issue in the environment when the issue occurs.  As discussed on the chat I am marking the case resolved.  You can re-open it if you need any further engagement on this issue and I will gladly assist.

Here is the summary of the discussion that we had:   - You were unable to access any of the instances in your account either via SSH or SSM.  - We have started our investigation by looking through the instances configuration from the AWS level and various cloudwatch metrics, but we are unable to figure out anything unusual with any of the statistics.  - Further, we looked through ""telnet"" and ""nmap"" and both shows no issues at all.  - On the whole, we were not seeing any issues with the AWS infrastructure or with the EC2 instances that could contribute to the problem.  - Just to confirm this, we have launched a fresh instance in the same region/VPC and it is working as expected.  - After sometime, the issue has automatically resolved and you are able to connect to all the instances without any issues.  Now, as we have concluded, since we are not seeing any issues from the AWS level here, we suspect, there was some changes being pushed to the EC2 instances that might have resulted in this issue, but as we AWS Support engineers lack visibility into customer's EC2 instances, we can only speculate on this matter. Please understand our limits.  However, since the issue is resolved now and as there are no outstanding queries, we are moving forward to archive this case for now.  Please feel free to get back to us by opening a new case, in case of any further queries/concerns, we will gladly assist you.  Thank you once again for choosing AWS and Have a nice day ahead.

8641384781,Accelyst Solutions Private Limited,Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2 - Linux),APAC,INDIA,isiaho,"Good day Rudram,  Harun here from AWS Premium Support. It was a pleasure chatting with you today.   To recap our conversation, you reached out to us because your EC2 instance 'i-07f83816922cdc1e7' started failing instance status checks after changing the instance type.  I checked the instance system logs as well as the screenshot and did not notice any errors. The screenshot output showed the login prompt. We then attached the root volume the instance to a rescue instance to investigate further. After reviewing the cloud-init logs, we noticed cloud-init had not run since the instance was launched. Due this reason, the instance was not getting an IP address resulting in instance status check failures.  To address this, we switched to a 'chroot' session and created the '/etc/rc.local' file with the content below    ----------------------------------------  cat /etc/rc.local  #!/bin/bash  /sbin/dhclient  ----------------------------------------  We then updated the permissions as below   $ chmod +x /etc/rc.local   We then attached the volume back to the original instance and it started successfully.  As agreed on chat, I will close this case for you since the issue has been resolved.  I hope you find this summary of the case helpful. If you have any other questions in this regard, kindly reach back to us and we will be happy to assist.  Thank you and have a great day ahead  We value your feedback.

To recap our discussion over the chat you reached out to us because you are experiencing Windows time get reset after you had restarted the time service or restarted the server.   During our discussion you confirmed that the server is joined to a domain and you also confirmed that after running the command (w32tm /resync /rediscover and w32tm /resync /force) the server now sync with the correct source. But this only occurs when the time service is restarted or the server is restarted.    I inform you that this is a normal behavior of Windows server operating system to get sync out of their right time and it's required from time to run the required commands to get the server sync back to the right time. As you have also confirmed that after running the above command and checking the source using this command (w32tm /query /source) it's syncing with the correct source.   You could also try to run the w32tm command to unregister the sync and re-register using the below steps.  First open a command prompt from the Server, right-click and run as administrator and type the following commands.  Net stop w32time   w32tm /unregister   w32tm /register   Net start w32time  To confirm whether the instances are now syncing with the correct time sources you run the same command as above.   This also works as the above command but just that it will unregister and re-register the process.    In the meantime I will go ahead and resolve the case from my end. However, you can always get back to us if you have any further information, and we will be happy to address it with you.   We value your feedback.

You reached out for some assistance with your instance i-078a880d0b2f8d1ad in that some changes were made to your ""oracle"" volume configuration and you were not able to mount it thereafter.  During our chat, we joined a screenshare session and call where you've informed me that the volume had been mistakenly deleted. Thereafter, you were not able to recreate the volume or remount it within the Operating System.  We tried to recreate the volume from a previous snapshot as well as from a previous AMI, though we were not able to recover the volume from these. I've asked you to create a new volume from an older snapshot but you needed to drop from the call at this time.

Here are the bullets of the things we did.  o Initially we started troubleshooting the issue where you were able to mount the LVM but while reading files from it it was throwing ""Input Output error"" o Further we tried to remount the lvm by re scanning the disks but still it didn't work o Later We tried to analyze the lvm configuration from the lvm backup directory. Here we noticed that the VG ""oraclevg"" is made up of two 100GB disk where we were trying with only one EBS volume of 100GB o Next we also checked the old lvm configuration from the archive directory where de noticed that the VG was created with only one PV that is pv0 o This indicated that there was some configuration change done unknowingly.  o To fix that we restored the vg from the old archive configuration file  o Still we were facing the same issue as the oracle setup files were in orphaned state o We manually killed those process by referring to the lsof output  o After this we were able to mount the LVM successfully. And the DB started working fine.   I hope this summary helps for now. In case if you have any further followup queries please do write me back. I would be happy to clarify it.

My name is Charles and it was a pleasure assisting you with your case today.  You reached out as you were getting a security notification that the default self-signed SSL certificate for your EC2 server [i-08eccdf0ce7c69369] was not trusted and wanted to confirm if AWS provides an SSL certificate for our Windows AMIs.  Over chat you explained that you wanted to find out if AWS provides SSL certificates along with our Windows AMIs. I explained that SSL certificates for use with your web servers does not ship with our Windows AMIs. However, if you are using a web server and need to use HTTPS, you will need to purchase an SSL certificate and install it on your web server. You mentioned that you are not looking to purchase an SSL certificate for your web server.   I reviewed the security notification you were getting over screen-share and observed that it was related to the RDP port 3389 self-signed certificate and not web server port 80. I explained that by default, to secure an RDP session, Windows generates a self-signed certificate [1]. You were getting the security notification because the self-signed certificate is not trusted by the Security Scanning application. However, you can purchase a public SSL certificate or configure an SSL certificate for the server using your Directory Certification Authority and install it on your server. Please refer to the links below:  Install Public SSL certificate for RDP connection to Windows Server - https://www.riptidehosting.com/blog/purchasing-and-installing-a-trusted-ssl-certificate-to-use-for-rdgw-rdsh/ Generate SSL Certificate for RDP connections from Directory Certification Authority - http://woshub.com/securing-rdp-connections-trusted-ssl-tls-certificates/ & https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XcCLSYOvGx0  I hope you have found my support today useful.

8677964621,Titan Industries,Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2 - Linux),APAC,INDIA,isiaho,"Good day Sudipta,  Harun here from AWS Premium Support. It was a pleasure talking with you today.   To recap our conversation, you reached out to us because you have an application running on the EC2 instance 'i-0d4a4164d7d46014a'. A feature that was disabled some time back was recently re-enabled but it is not working as expected. When the application tries to download a file from an API endpoint, it results in an 'error 500'.  We confirmed that you were able to download the same file using standard Linux tools such as 'curl' and 'wget' from the same EC2 instance without errors. I also reviewed the resources on the instance and did not notice any issues.  Since you are only encountering the error when running the application/code, this means there may be an issue with either the code or the vendors side. As mentioned on call, the error may need to be resolved on the server side. It is not an issue with your EC2 instance or network connectivity. Error 500 means that the web server is telling you that something went wrong, but it's not sure exactly what that is[1]. I suggested you reach out to your vendor to check why their server is returning error 500 and advise how to fix it.  I hope you find this summary of the case helpful. If you have any other questions in this regard, kindly reach back to us and we will be happy to assist.  Thank you and have a great day ahead  [References]  [1] http://net-informations.com/q/mis/500.html  We value your feedback.

8684058521,TataSky Ltd,Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2 - Windows),APAC,INDIA,rapsilva,"Hi Rahul, Thanks for your time on the chat today!  As a recap, you have two instances that are unable to communicate with the WSUS server.  During our chat we checked the security group rules from the two instances i-088adb17632719fec and i-0cf3cdfeeaf898bb7 and found that the rules were correct. However, since you have only allowed egress connections on port 8530, I explained that usually an outbound connection comes from an ephemeral port, as confirmed from the netstat command you ran.   For testing purposes, we allowed all egress traffic from the instance and also allowed all inbound traffic from the WSUS instance, but the tnc command was still failing. Since we allowed all traffic at the security group level and it is still not working, it is clear that there is something at the OS level blocking this connection.  I suggest you to check if there is any antivirus or local firewall blocking it from either the two instances or the WSUS instance side. Check if there is a reboot pending from either instances. And also check if the Windows Firewall is indeed disabled or if there is any deny rule in place.  Since this issue is on the OS level, unfortunately there is not much I can help as I have no visibility. If you need any further guidance on checking event viewer or any other log just let me know.

It’s Jailosi again here, we had a chat earlier today.  You reached out because you needed assistance with accessing the CentOS 7 instance that you launched with IMDSv2. When you try to access the instance through SSH, you were getting errors that connection refused.  During the chat we connected through chime where you shared your screen where we checked and confirmed that you are able to access the same type of instance but launched with IMDSv1.   I went on to replicate the issue on my side which produced the same results. Seeing that I needed to dive deeper into the issue, I requested that I work on in from my lab environment and share with you the outcome or solution.  In my lab environment, I was not successful at finding the solution to the issue so that you can launch the instance with IMDSv2. However, As a work around, I launched the same instance with metadata option set to use IMDSv1 or IMDSv2 then changed it to IMDSv2 only which by default makes IMDSv1 unavailable. This was achieved using the command below.   aws ec2 modify-instance-metadata-options \     --instance-id i-1234567898abcdef0 \     --http-tokens required \     --http-endpoint enabled  Further more, I noticed that this problem is currently being observed on CentOS 7 only, I managed to launch other instances with IMDSv2 without any problem. The following instances worked fine:  CentOS 8 RHEL 7 and 8 Ubuntu Amazon Linux 2  I’ve open an internal case for further assistance with this matter as it appears to affect CentOS 7 specifically, in the meantime you can enable IMDSv2 using the workaround I mentioned above. As mentioned, I tried it and confirm that it worked.  Please see the link in the reference section below for more detail on modifying instance metadata options for existing instances [1]  Hopefully, the above information I have provided you with will be helpful.

8701994401,Edelweiss Financial Services Ltd,Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2 - Linux),APAC,INDIA,pmmulon,"Hello Prathamesh,  Paul here again from AWS Premium Support. It was a pleasure talking to you earlier.  Below is a brief summary of our session.  You had contacted us to assist you in investigating why your EC2 instance was unreachable via SSH.  On my initial review, I observed that the instance ' i-03e857d8a3dc63ee3' was running in a healthy state. Additionally, I could also see that the security group, NACL rules and VPC routing had been properly configured to allow SSH traffic from your local PC to the EC2 instance.  During the troubleshooting session, I could see that the SSH port was unreachable from your local PC despite your IP being allowed in the instance's security group:   $ telnet 10.224.93.89 22  When checking for connectivity to other ports, we could see that the instance was indeed reachable:   $ ping 10.224.93.89  On further investigation, I noted that from instance's system logs, there was no evidence of the SSH service getting started.  To remedy the issue, I advised you run the following user data script, that would remove any OS firewall rules that might be restricting access to SSH and restart the SSH service as well:  Content-Type: multipart/mixed; boundary=""//"" MIME-Version: 1.0  --// Content-Type: text/cloud-config; charset=""us-ascii"" MIME-Version: 1.0 Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit Content-Disposition: attachment; filename=""cloud-config.txt""  #cloud-config cloud_final_modules: - [scripts-user, always]  --// Content-Type:     text/x-shellscript; charset=""us-ascii"" MIME-Version: 1.0 Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit Content-Disposition: attachment; filename=""userdata.txt""  #!/bin/bash iptables -F service sshd restart --//   Note:     -  The script flushes all main iptables rules, not just for port 22. After you regain access to the instance, review your firewall configuration (for example, ufw, firewalld, iptables).   - The script is set to run on every reboot of the instance. After regaining access to your instance, remove the user data script.

Thank you for your time over the chat today, it was a pleasure assisting you.  It looks like you were no longer available at your desk, hence I had to disconnect the chat at my end. That being said, please find a short summary of our conversation as below:  ============  -- You reached out as you wanted to know the reason behind the high network level data transfer usage corresponding to your instances for the month of July and were looking for an assistance on the same. Upon our conversation, we discussed the following:     -> Using my internal tools, I could confirm that indeed there were high data transfers happening in the mentioned instances i.e. i-017c6a212a27537ce and i-053233c00644a6c2d which is why you were being charged so much for the instance data transfers.     -> Following this, you wished to know of a way by which you can determine the cause of the data transfer (the applications performing this transfer). To this, we discussed that AWS Premium Support engineers don’t have resource level access due to the data privacy policy we follow. Hence, in order to check this you’ll need to install network monitoring tools inside the instances and log the network data transfer data inside the instance so that you can access and identify the applications causing this data transfer.     -> Upon checking further, I could see that the instances in question were windows OS based instance. We discussed, that since I’m from the EC2 linux team, I don’t have an expertise in handling Windows instances and hence don’t have much idea on the tools and techniques you can use to get this data from your instances.  That being said, I mentioned that it would be best for you to raise a case with the windows team as they would have a better expertise and visibility in assisting you with this query moving forward.  ============  Hope this helps.

You reached out for some assistance with instances i-022d71e193b79b62b and i-05da241a8abd1da00 in that you are not able to access them via SSH.  Looking at instance i-022d71e193b79b62b, I can see that the instance has booted into emergency mode. In this mode, the kernel provides a minimal bootable environment which allows you to repair your system even in situations when rescue mode is unavailable. More information about emergency mode can be found here [3].  Unfortunately I am unable to pinpoint the exact cause of the failure since we are not allowed OS level access to customer instances and logs for security and privacy reasons. I've advised that you would need to review the file system of the root volume attached to this instance in order to determine a root cause and possible fix. Some of the most common reasons why an instance will boot into emergency mode include possible kernel corruption or auto-mount failures because of incorrect entries in the /etc/fstab file. I noticed that you have an additional 500GiB volume attached to this instance so it is very possible that the mount instruction for this volume in the /etc/fstab file is not correct and causing the system to boot into emergency mode - though it will require further troubleshooting to determine this.  You've informed me that you need to reach out to your internal team before performing any additional troubleshooting steps. I've included a link that will help you troubleshoot this for a possible resolution, please follow the guide here once you are able to  [1].  Regarding instance i-05da241a8abd1da00, we ended our chat before we could troubleshoot it any further - I continued investigating after our chat but I was not able to find any indication of why you are not able to access the instance.

You can run the following commands to check for a listening service:  netstat -tunl | grep 61621 netstat -tunl | grep 7001 netstat -tunl | grep 61621  If we find that the security groups do not allow for the traffic on the ports in question but there are services listening on the ports in question, I anticipate that is what Dome9 is looking at the operating system to determine compliance of open ports. You would be protected/compliant in this case because the security group would prevent any traffic from reaching the instance on those ports.  If both the security groups do not allow the traffic and there are no service listening on the ports, then this looks like a false-positive from Dome9 and I would reach out to Check Point support for help.   I hope my reply has got us moving in the right direction to answer your questions and I look forward to your reponse!  We value your feedback.

8730564881,Manthan Software Services,Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2 - Linux),APAC,INDIA,rakshc,"Hi Kaushik,  Thank you for your valuable time on chat today. Please find a brief summary of our discussion below:  You reached out to us as you wanted to increase the maximum value of stack segment size to unlimited. I informed you that you can do so by adding below entries to /etc/security/limits.conf file: <user>            hard    stack           unlimited <user>             soft    stack           unlimited  I also added that setting this unlimited may cause memory crunch on the instance when your program will use complete segment space. For eg, if there is a buggy code that gets stuck in an infinite loop and if that infinite loop happens to contain a recursive function call, the stack would quickly eat all the available memory. The soft limit on the stack size prevents this: the program will crash but the rest of the OS will be unaffected. Hence, I mentioned that instead of mentioning unlimited you can increase the soft and hard limit to a specific number and increase it gradually as per the code requirement. You decided to set the limit to 40GB for ec2-user.  Further, please feel free to reach out to us for any follow-up concern and we will happily assist you.  We value your feedback.

To summarize our conversation, you reached out to us as you were unable to patch the security updates inside your Ec2 instance i-0e0893adfcfc6a303 and you got below error:  ===================== Error:  Multilib version problems found. This often means that the root        cause is something else and multilib version checking is just        pointing out that there is a problem. Eg.:           1. You have an upgrade for glibc which is missing some             dependency that another package requires. Yum is trying to             solve this by installing an older version of glibc of the             different architecture. If you exclude the bad architecture             yum will tell you what the root cause is (which package             requires what). You can try redoing the upgrade with             --exclude glibc.otherarch ... this should give you an error             message showing the root cause of the problem.           2. You have multiple architectures of glibc installed, but             yum can only see an upgrade for one of those architectures.             If you don't want/need both architectures anymore then you             can remove the one with the missing update and everything             will work.           3. You have duplicate versions of glibc installed already.             You can use ""yum check"" to get yum show these errors.         ...you can also use --setopt=protected_multilib=false to remove        this checking, however this is almost never the correct thing to        do as something else is very likely to go wrong (often causing        much more problems).         Protected multilib versions: glibc-2.17-324.el7_9.i686 != glibc-2.17-317.el7.x86_64 =====================  First up, the error you are getting is the result of having one package installed on the system that when trying to update has another version for a different architecture, for example x86_64 vs i686.

I am sending this email as a recap of our conversation.  You have contacted us today because your EC2 instance ID ""i-0eb95568baf537d15"" went unreachable and you want to know the root cause.  During our chat, I have checked the health of the instance ""i-0eb95568baf537d15"", and found that it was currently in a running state and passing both status checks, indicating that from an AWS perspective, everything seems to be working as expected as the mentioned instance is running on a healthy hardware[1].  I confirmed with you if there were any changes at the OS level, and you confirmed that nothing was changed that you were aware of.  I have also checked the Windows instance CloudWatch metrics, and I could see that the instance ""i-0eb95568baf537d15"" failed instance status checks on 18/08/2021 at approximately 10:38 until 10:58 UTC, and on 19/08/2021 at approximately 06:15 until 06:35 UTC [2] as well.  As I mentioned on the chat, a failed Instance Status Check can indicate a corrupted file system, incorrect networking or startup configuration within your Windows Instance. Documentation explaining the causes of a failed Instance Status Check can be found below [3].  I have also checked the Cloudtrail logs and I noticed the ""RebootInstances"" API call from the time it was being rebooted[4][5].

My name is Anjali and I will be assisting you on this case today.  I understand that your EC2 instance 'i-031ed6bfbb28edf73' was stuck today. You want our assistance to troubleshoot the issue. Please feel free to correct me if I misunderstood the concern.  Firstly, while going through the case notes, I see that your case initially came in as a chat and it was unanswered. Apologies for the inconvenience you might have faced due to this.  I went ahead with the investigation to check for the case #8742650741 and could confirm that the engineer had identified that the system was dropping the caches and there is cron script running in your instance. You mentioned that you have removed the cron scripts from your instance still you faced a similar issue with the instance.  Moving ahead, I investigated the instance side metrics for the previous 24 hours. The instance was passing both the health checks which implies that the instance is fine from the AWS infrastructure perspective. I then investigated the CPU, NetworkIn/NetworkOut and EBS root volume metrics and they all were well within limits. I checked the console logs of the instance and could see the following.

8753731261,Dell Technologies,Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2 - Windows),APAC,INDIA,ricaribe,"Hello Pramod,  Thank you for contacting AWS Premium Support. My name is Ricardo from the EC2 Windows Team in Dublin, and I will be in charge of your case.  I understand that you are trying to retrieve the administrator password of the instance ID ""i-0267b0f7cc94b06ea"" on the EC2 console, however it keeps showing the message ""Please wait at least 4 minutes after launching an instance before trying to retrieve the auto-generated password"". Please let me know if that is correct and feel free to add any details.  Analysis ======== If you have waited for at least 10 minutes and the instance keeps showing the same message, the most common cause is that the instance was launched from a custom AMI which was not configured to run EC2Launch on first boot to generate a new password automatically. In this case, the old password is captured as part of the AMI creation process and that password cannot be retrieved from the console. The EC2 console will keep showing the described message that the password is not available.  On reviewing the instance ""i-0267b0f7cc94b06ea"", I can see that it was launched from a custom AMI ""ami-4259953f"".  Please kindly note that, since the instance is launched using a custom AMI and that the issue resides at OS level, due to compliance and security reasons[1][2], AWS do not have access to customer`s OS level, therefore further troubleshooting and investigation is required on your end.  Action Plan =========== To gain access to the instance, please try the following:   1) Logon with RDP using the same administrator password that was previously set on the instance from where the AMI originated. If you know the password and logon is successful, then you can keep the same password, change the password on Windows, or run EC2LaunchSetting.exe to configure a random password generation on next reboot that can be retrieved from the console.   2) If you cannot logon to the instance, you can use ""EC2Rescue"" to generate a new password.

After this, we mounted the original root volume to another EC2 instance and mounted on /mnt. We checked the logs and saw the /usr/bin/snap did not exist. We installed the same by following below steps:  cd / for i in dev proc sys run; do mount -o bind /$i /mnt/$i; done chroot /mnt ls -lah /usr/bin/snap apt remove snapd -y apt install snapd -y   And then unmounted the volume and attached back to the original volume. However, the instance failed status checks still. Then as a last resort, I suggested you the following:  - Launch a fresh instance from this AMI ami-0b84c6433cdbe5c3e - Then log into this instance - Attach the problematic volume and mount on this new instance - And copy over the data to new instance - When the data copying is complete, unmount and detach the volume - Then terminate the problematic instance  With this we ended the session. I trust I was helpful. However, in case you have any further queries, please do not hesitate to reach me back via this case and I’ll be happy to assist you further.   We value your feedback.

My name is Meenal and I am glad to have assisted you on chat today.  Your instance I-0eab91dd8501766f0 was stuck in stopping state for a long time and took more than 20 minutes to stop.

8766674791,Ibibo Group,Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2 - Linux),APAC,INDIA,pmmulon,"Hello Ankit,  Paul here again from AWS Premium Support. It was a pleasure chatting with you earlier.  Below is a brief summary of our session.  You had contacted us to assist you with the use of AWS CLI to list EC2 instances based on applied tags.  During the chat, you explained that you had managed to run the following command which only listed instances based on a single Tag Key:   $ aws ec2 describe-instances --filters ""Name=instance-state-code,Values=16"" --output text --query 'Reservations[*].Instances[?not_null(Tags[?Key == `Name`].Value)].[InstanceId,Tags[?Key==`Name`].Value,PrivateIpAddress,Tags[?Key==`Lob`].Value]'  I went on ahead and to replicate on my lab environment and could see that the logical AND operator can be used as follows to list instances based on multiple Tag Keys:   $ aws ec2 describe-instances --filters ""Name=instance-state-code,Values=16"" --output text --query 'Reservations[*].Instances[?not_null(Tags[?Key == `Name`].Value) && not_null(Tags[?Key == `LOB`].Value)].[InstanceId,Tags[?Key==`Name`].Value,PrivateIpAddress,Tags[?Key==`Lob`].Value]'  The above CLI command will list instances that have both the Tag Keys Name and LOB.  As an example, I applied the following tag keys to 4 of my instances in my lab environment: 'sample' and 'sample2'.  Based on the above scenario, I used the following CLI command to get a list of the instance IDs that have both 'sample' and 'sample2' applied:   $ aws ec2 describe-instances --query 'Reservations[].Instances[?not_null(Tags[?Key == `sample`]) && not_null(Tags[?Key == `sample2`])] | [].InstanceId'  I trust this correspondence proves useful.

You mentioned that the instance i-080ad288264731d4e is failing its status checks once it was removed from the domain. During the investigation on the chat I reviewed the hardware of the instance and confirmed that there were no issues identified by the underlying hardware.  Next I checked the instance backend screenshot and mentioned that the instance is booted up and I can see the login screen, however there is a warning with the network connection. Assuming that this could be due to a network interface misconfiguration from the OS end, I advised you to create a new network interface and attach it to the instance.  However post this, you confirmed that the issue was still not resolved and the instance was not reachable. We identified that the DHCP client service was getting disabled and stopped after the domain disjoin operation.  We then tried to perform the EC2rescue method, however the rescue tool did not allow us to select the offline instance. I mentioned that this could be due to the restrictive environment and the Anti-virus on the instances. Hence I advised to launch an ec2 instance using the amazon provided public AMI's.  You launched an instance however due to restrictions in your environment we were unable to connect to it and use it as a helper instance.  Next we explored the possibility of  using the User data scripts to inject and start the DHCP service but as the instances were migrated from cloud endure and did not have EC2 Launch we were unable to use this option as well.  I then ran a test in my lab and I was able to use the offline registry method to enable the service and then I advised the same steps to you.

Upon further investigation and network test connectivity, I noticed that this instance was launched from a custom AMI ""ami-029468d11c18f6808"".   Please kindly note that, since the instance is launched using a custom AMI and that the issue resides at OS level, due to compliance and security reasons [4], AWS does not have visibility into our customer`s OS level. Therefore, further troubleshooting and investigation is required on your end [5].  Having checked all the above details and for troubleshooting purpose, I suggested the following:   1. Create a temporary elastic network interface, and attach the network interface to the Amazon EC2 Windows instance [6].  2. In order to try recovering access to this instance, you can also use ""EC2Rescue"" tool.

I understand that you were unable to access the application from the EC2 server i-01213130ae51a0225 and it required a reboot to gain the access.   I reviewed the console logs and noted the last console logs are during around 2021-08-20T19:31:51 UTC when the instance was last started. However, I noted an OOM killer (out of memory) execution on the server from the instance screen shot which killed a process named s1-agent. I am attaching the same screen shot for your reference as well.   You may want to log into the server and review the /var/log/messages log to get more information on OOM killer execution. Also, please confirm the time frame of OOM killer execution with the issue of application. As its name suggests, OOM killer gets executed when the server runs out of memory[2]. The server may either genuinely run out of memory due to application memory usage or a memory leak within the application may cause this behavior. You may either switch to a larger instance size[1] to provide more resources to the server or dig deeper into possibility of memory leak before moving ahead with scaling operation.   I trust this helps! If you have more questions, please feel free to reach out.

I am Lakshmipriya and I will be assisting you with the case today.  From the case correspondence, I understood that the instance i-053765a581859480e was showing as not reachable since 27th Aug and it started working fine after reboot. You would like to know the cause of this instance.  To start with, I have checked the health check of instance i-053765a581859480e and could see that it failed instance status check from 2021-08-27 13:18 UTC and recovered at 2021-08-30 06:38 UTC. But no system status check failure is showing at that time.  System status checks monitor the AWS systems on which your instance runs. These checks detect underlying problems with your instance that require AWS involvement to repair. Instance status checks monitor the software and network configuration of your individual instance. Usually, the instance status check failure indicates a problem with the instance due to operating system-level errors such as the following:    1.  Failure to boot the operating system  2.  Failure to mount volumes correctly  3.  File system issues  4.  Incompatible drivers  5.  Kernel panic  6. Instance status checks might also fail due to severe memory pressures caused by over-utilisation of instance resources.    I have then analyzed the CPU utilization and volume performance of the instance. Even though logs showing CPU utilisation, it is not hitting the limit. When checking the volume performance, I could  see a  slight hike in the read IOPS just before the instance check failure. Note that, we do not have access to customer instances and configuration due to Shared Security Responsibility Model and AWS Data privacy [2][3] policies. Hence we would recommend you to contact your system administrator and check the application level logs and system log to see any resource/memory usage related errors corresponding to the time the instance started showing instance check failure.

I understand that your EC2 instances rebooted and you would like to know the reason for reboot of these instances.[i-05f64c2e7ef6ed439,i-07b4d7872cda2cdd7]  I have checked these instances and I do not find any underlying host issue which could have contributed to reboot of these instances. Both of the instances have nothing in common, they are running on different hosts. Further I did check EBS internal stats as well but no signs of failure have been found there as well.  Now to analyze what caused reboot, I tried checking console logs as well but there is nothing much {no errors/failures observed} apart from CPU spike on i-05f64c2e7ef6ed439.   https://ap-south-1.console.aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/deeplink.js?region=ap-south-1#metricsV2:graph=%7B%22metrics%22%3A%5B%5B%22AWS%2FEC2%22%2C%22CPUUtilization%22%2C%22InstanceId%22%2C%22i-05f64c2e7ef6ed439%22%5D%5D%2C%22stat%22%3A%22Maximum%22%2C%22period%22%3A300%2C%22start%22%3A%222021-09-01T13%3A48%3A03.310Z%22%2C%22end%22%3A%222021-09-02T13%3A48%3A03.310Z%22%2C%22region%22%3A%22ap-south-1%22%7D  So it looks like there could have something happened at OS level which would have caused reboot.

Firstly, I have examined your Windows instance i-0c7d0163849ddf0af and I can confirm from our internal tools that this instance is utilizing BYOL licensing.

Nevertheless, you can still receive the Billing information from within the Windows instance i-0c7d0163849ddf0af by accessing the instance and executing the following PowerShell command as administrator:  ((Invoke-WebRequest http://169.254.169.254/latest/dynamic/instance-identity/document).Content | ConvertFrom-Json).billingProducts   The above command will return the Billing-Product value (bp-xxxxxx) on basis of which we can find if the instance is using BYOL or a Windows license provided by AWS. It also queries the Instance Metadata and searches for the billing information, for more information on Instance Metadata please read the below documentation.

According to the docs [1], it should be able to reach a maximum of 850MB/s, with an I/O size of 128KiB;    .You have several volumes attached to the instance, and the instance is likely going to be the limiter of performance in this scenario;    .Your main interest was in the time between 9AM and 4PM in Indian Standard time; as our metrics are all in UTC, this would mean between 03:30AM and 10:30AM UTC.    .We have discussed a bit the implications of the throughput and how to read them;    .You would like to know how to use CloudWatch Metrics to know about total instance throughput;    .You have requested me to provide you via the case the updates with the numbers.

Please find the summary of our chat below:  You contacted as you were unable to access internet from the instance i-012ae2e9ff0985701. On checking I could find that there is Internet gateway attached to the Route table associated with the instance. However this is not having a public or Elastic IP address.  A public IP address is required for an EC2 to access internet via an Internet Gateway [1].  Now you have the following options:  Next steps :  1. First option : you can allocate a new Elastic ip and associate with the EC2 instance using the steps provided in this [2] documentation. However then the instance will be in public subnet and accessible via this elastic IP address.  2. You can update the route table and replace the internet gateway IGW with a NAT gateway, this will allow all the EC2 instances in the subnet to access the internet without an Elastic IP address assigned.  As you mentioned that you do not have access to make changes, we had to wind up our chat. Please do not hesitate to reach out in case of any queries or concerns.   We will be more than happy to assist. Have a great day ahead!!  Please let us know if you require any further assistance whatsoever.

Below I am sharing a brief summary of our discussion.   You reached out to us with an issue that  your instance has failed the status checks and you restarted the system to fix the issue bit you would like to know the reason behind the same.   Starting with the investigation, I checked the instance system logs and instance screenshot but did not find any error or service failure. Further I checked the CloudWatch metrics of your instance and could see that your instance was around 90% CPU utilisation.    Then we ran 'top' command and could see that one firewall application is consuming most of the CPU and RAM. So you uninstalled that firewall package and then your CPU went to normal.   As discussed, I am marking this case as Closed. If you have any other queries or concerns, feel free to write back. I would be happy to assist.

We've went on a Chime meeting, where you've also shared your screen, and from there we could see that both volumes had the same UUID and disk label. This is likely because both of them came from the same snapshot.  That said, your /etc/fstab entries were booting from the disk label, but since both volumes had the same label, it would boot from any of them at random. We've then corrected this by changing the label and UUID of the new volume, and correcting the fstab entries, but after doing so, instance was unable to boot from the shrunk volume.  Checking from the console screenshot from my end, I could see that your instance was unable to boot, likely due to something broken at the initramfs part.  As we spoke over call, the data was previously simply moved using rsync, and neither GRUB nor initramfs were reinstalled in the new volume. Although it would work if this was a secondary volume, this is not the proper way to migrate the data from a root volume, as it will break the boot process.  Since the volume was not properly shrunk, we've agreed that I would send you the steps on how to properly shrink your root volume over email, and you'd try them again.   # Next steps --------------------------- Before proceeding any further, kindly note that unfortunately, shrinking EBS volumes is not officially supported by AWS. That said, it is still possible to work around that, but please note that, these operations are performed at your own risk, as they may incur in data loss.
