I have one query here, that Cloudwatch merics are not proving accurate for planning capacity?   So for example in my current case we are running Elasticsearch on EC2 instance. The thing is Cloudwatch shows my CPU utilisation is just 20-30% and my host level metrics show its 80-100%. Beyond 100% on my host, i cannot utilize compute anymore irrespective thats its just 20-30% on hypervisor. If i consider the hypervisor stats i have room to scale down my instance to half. I did tried that in past but that reduced the performance and instances got unresponsive due to load.   Any suggestion for such case as Cloudwatch metrics are not proving accurate/helpful for capacity planning.

At this point the only  safe thing yum can do is fail. There are a few ways to work ""fix"" this:       1. Contact the upstream for the repository and get them to fix the problem.       2. Reconfigure the baseurl/etc. for the repository, to point to a working         upstream. This is most often useful if you are using a newer         distribution release than is supported by the repository (and the         packages for the previous distribution release still work).       3. Run the command with the repository temporarily disabled             yum --disablerepo=<repoid> ...       4. Disable the repository permanently, so yum won't use it by default. Yum         will then just ignore the repository until you permanently enable it         again or use --enablerepo for temporary usage:              yum-config-manager --disable <repoid>         or             subscription-manager repos --disable=<repoid>       5. Configure the failing repository to be skipped, if it is unavailable.         Note that yum will try to contact the repo. when it runs most commands,         so will have to try and fail each time (and thus. yum will be be much         slower).

The cluster with instance in same AZ are not facing issue.   We have created 2 new cluster using same automation and varied the subnet to get instance in same AZ. All the configs are same. On running the load we found the cluster with same instances in same AZ works much better than the one having instance 2 AZ.   Is there any way we can improve performance between 2 AZs as this is taking big toll on performance in our case( Almost 20-40% as we seen last time ).

What is the expanded support agreement between Amazon and Microsoft, and how does it benefit me?  For customers that have purchased AWS Support at the Business or Enterprise tier, AWS Support is able to work directly with Microsoft support engineers to resolve issues related to customers running Microsoft Windows Server, SQL Server, or Windows desktop (via Amazon Workspaces) on AWS. As a result of this expanded support agreement, AWS can engage directly with Microsoft to create the best possible support experience. If necessary, AWS Support can escalate issues directly to Microsoft and work with dedicated Microsoft support engineers to help ensure issues are addressed and resolved.

I don't see the parameter set in our /etc/cloud/cloud.cfg file. As a follow up question are you aware if this is a consistent behavior? i.e. does the hostname always change after yum update and reboot when ""preserve_hostname: true"" is not added to the /etc/cloud/cloud.cfg file. While I have to investigate how the hostname is set here, I was wondering that we have not seen this earlier for this machine and several others with similar configuration. So is it just a matter of chance that this happens or does this always happen, consistently when ""preserve_hostname: true"" is not added to the /etc/cloud/cloud.cfg file?

You discussed below point with my colleague Sohaib :  - The instance i-04b6c49211713957a got auto-recovered and is moved to new & healthy underlying hardware/host. - No need to perform stop/start operation onto the instance and no action is required from your end. - While performing stop/start operation onto the instance, only the Public IP will change (not private/EIP[1]) and the data residing in the instance-store [2] volumes would be lost (& not from EBS volumes).

It was a pleasure chatting with you today.  Below is a summary of our chat session.  You reached out to us because the EC2 instance 'i-0899276581f2ec65a' was running very slow. You wanted us to confirm if the instance was being throttled at maximum throughput.  I confirmed that the instance, which is an 'r5.8xlarge', was intermittently reaching its maximum throughput of 850 MB/s.   An mentioned in the case ID 7299116571, to get more instance level throughput limit you may need to increase the instance type to a larger instance type that supports higher throughput.  See link below for the different instance types and maximum throughput values   - https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ebs-optimized.html  I trust that the above information proves useful to you and answers your question.

7009,7346963281,Mylan,Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2 - Linux),APAC,INDIA,alyokoku,"Hello Manjunatha,      Alex here from AWS Support in Sydney. Thank you for reaching out. Below you'll find a quick summary and next steps.      In a nutshell, you were experiencing issues to run ""yum repolist"" from Red Hat OS running on EC2 instance i-0bfc988e4d8aab795. I've double checked the security groups, NACLs, and route-table but I didn't observe anything that would stand out. You have rules to allow outbound connection to the internet so it seems.      The only thing I'm not too sure is that the default gateway in your VPC points to vgw-ca1cfea3, which could be a firewall in your infrastructure. However, we tried a couple commands with curl to make sure that this instance could establish an outbound connection to the following addresses:          rhui2-cds01.us-east-1.aws.ce.redhat.com / 54.211.52.203         rhui2-cds02.us-east-1.aws.ce.redhat.com / 35.175.60.178         rhui3.us-east-1.aws.ce.redhat.com / 52.200.186.197      During the troubleshooting, it appears to me that you might have a transparent proxy. Therefore, although curl command for the addresses above worked out, I would recommend you to check out with the network team whether those addresses above are whitelisted just to confirm. For more details about RHUI 2 and RHUI 3 changes, please check out the following links [1][2] that contains more details about Red Hat changes that I talked about it.      Since we observed a different result for the certificate issuer when trying to connect to RHUI repositories with curl, we are not too sure about the integrity of the files that come with package rh-amazon-rhui-client. So, going forward, also experiment downloading that package from a working instance using yumdownloader.          # yumdownloader rh-amazon-rhui-client      This is going to fetch the latest version of the package named rh-amazon-rhui-client-3.0.32-1.el7.noarch.rpm. Next, create a backup of the EC2 instance i-0bfc988e4d8aab795 using EBS snapshot or any other method that you have available.

7018,7349073351,Axis Bank Limited,Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2 - Linux),APAC,INDIA,joshkuna,"Hello Rohan,   I checked the details of the setup in production environment and found the following -   Bucket owner - 008300461057  caller -  arn:aws:iam::008300461057:role/S3_Read_only  This configuration is expected to work as the caller is from the bucket owner account and satisfies the evaluation logic for ACL as per [1].  This does not work in current implementation in control tower because -    bucket - aws-landing-zone-logs-612474255603-ap-south-1 - owner - arn:aws:iam::902425822529:role/Qradar_SIEM_ReadOnly  caller - arn:aws:iam::902425822529:role/Qradar_SIEM_ReadOnly  This will not work as objects are uploaded by cloudtrail, hence cloudtrail is the object owner. Hence, the bucket owner cannot control access to log objects using bucket policy. To resolve this issue, one solution is to assume a role in bucket owner account 612474255603 and then make the API calls.  Since QRadar does not allow assume role directly with instance profile role, you need to configure access keys from infosec account and provide the role ARN of role in bucket account.  Also, since QRadar also supports directly providing access keys, you can also create a user in bucket owner account, configure credentials and then configure them with QRadar.  I'll be reaching out to Lakhvinder to set up time where we can connect over call and drive this to resolution.  Please let me know if you have queries for me in the meanwhile.

7056,7360324401,HDFC Life Insurance Company Limited,Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2 - Linux),APAC,INDIA,andrse,"Hello Praveen,  It was a pleasure talking to you today on our chat. As you know you initiated the chat today because you are experiencing slowness on your instance.  Instance ID: i-09183c975ad1e3bd1  On reviewing the instance I could see that the root volumes burst credit was depleted which would explain as to why you are experiencing slowness. [1] Due to the root volume having no credits you are operating at the baseline of the volume. As the instance would try to request more IO then what is allocated this would cause the slowness.  I explained that to resolve the issue there are three things you can do. 1. Increase the volume size. 2. Change volume type. 3. Narrow down the application on the instance over utilizing the volume.  For your volume types you can see here. -- https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ebs-volume-types.html#ebs-volume-characteristics  As you are using a GP2 volume the performance scales as the volume size increases, the option here would be to increase volume size.  Second option would be to change to a IO1 volume type where you can select the amount of IO that you wish to use.  With regards to changing and scaling a volume.  You will need to modify the volume. -- https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ebs-modify-volume.html  After modification you will need to modify the filesystem on the volume if you have changed its size. -- https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/recognize-expanded-volume-linux.html  More information on this. -- https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/expand-root-ebs-linux/  I hope this is of help to you.

Hence, you were looking for an assistance on the same.  Upon our conversation, we went ahead and injected a new SSH public key pair inside the instance using the user-data script.  =========================== Creating a new Key-Pair ===========================  Step 1: Downloading the Key-pair from E2 Console:  Go to the AWS EC2 Management Console (where you can see the instances running) > On the left console, youll find Key Pairs under the Network and Security Section (as shown in screenshot 1) > Click on the Key Pairs > Now, youll see on the right Create key pair > Click on it > provide a name (for eg: test) > Create key-pair  Once you have created the key-pair, itll be downloaded in your local machine.   Step 2: Generating the public key for your private key:  1. Open PuTTYkeygen using PuTTY 2. In the 'Actions' pane, select 'Load an existing private key file'. 3. Select the file that you had downloaded from the console.             Note: A confirmation displays after PuTTYgen successfully imports the private key. Click OK to dismiss the message. 4. Enter a 'Key Passphrase'. Confirm it.  5. Save private key. Save public key.   Now, You'll have a private key and a public key with you.  3.

This is the same issue that we noticed on the previous instance. From the Errors we have seen, the Issue may have been caused because the AMI was Sysprepped using the Microsoft Sysprep tool. Here are the Logs:  - 2020/09/12 21:35:19Z: EC2ConfigMonitorState: 0 - 2020/09/12 21:35:19Z: Windows is being configured. SysprepState=IMAGE_STATE_UNDEPLOYABLE - 2020/09/12 21:35:22Z: Driver: AWS NVMe Driver v1.3.2.53  - 2020/09/12 21:35:22Z: Driver: AWS PV Driver Package v8.3.2  - 2020/09/12 21:35:22Z: Driver: Amazon Elastic Network Adapter v2.1.5.0 - 2020/09/12 21:36:19Z: Windows is still being configured. SysprepState=IMAGE_STATE_UNDEPLOYABLE  The preferred way of doing Sysprep is using the EC2Config Service. The EC2Config Service is by default installed on all EC2 instances. It is installed under C:\Program Files\Amazon\Ec2ConfigService. However, since images are BYOL they may not have EC2Config installed. I would recommend to install EC2Config on one of the instances and run Sysprep with the tool. These links can be used as reference for this [1][2]. Once the process completes, save the new AMI as the base Image and test launching an additional Instance from the new AMI to see if the issue is solved.   As an alternative, this issue can be fixed with the same Registry Keys that we changed previously from the following path:  - HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Setup\State - Change the values from ""IMAGE_STATE_UNDEPLOYABLE"" to IMAGE_STATE_COMPLETE""  I hope that the information provided may assist you.

7156,7391527711,ALL_DEPRECATED,Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2 - Linux),APAC,INDIA,alyokoku,"Hello,      Alex here from AWS Support in Sydney. Thank you for reaching out to EC2 Linux. Below you'll find a quick summary.      In a nutshell, I've confirmed that your limit request submitted via case number 7391337531 was applied correctly. The new limit for nu.general is 17804, and not 228 per wording found in the original case.      Later, I've found out that you've got an automated message from the system about the limit increase request. Discussing internally with the CS team, sounds like the tool by default will increase according to the value requested, and not set a new limit to what was requested. In this case, as we confirmed, it was increased from 17576 to 17804 as expected.      I'm logging an internal ticket here to have someone to review the automated message to avoid confusion in the future. However, we here at AWS Support don't have an ETA to provide, as this falls outside of our control. For now, you can expect someone to rectify the message in the original case.

I am Sunny and it was my pleasure to assist you on chat today. Below I am posting a quick summary of our chat today.  From the case notes I can understand that you were seeing high load average value for the Instance  i-08857c414bff91648 after which the instance became unresponsive and you need to manually stop start the instance to bring it up and running.  I checked the Instance  i-08857c414bff91648 using my internal tools and could see that the instance failed System status check on 2020-09-12 at 12:37 UTC [1]. Upon further checking the issue I can confirm that the underlying hardware on which the Instance was running became unavailable for the same timestamp when the Instance failed System status check. Further I can confirm that the underlying hardware became available after a while and the Instance started passing 2/2 status check and was running up and healthy.  Moving further I can see from the attached screenshot that you were experiencing a high load average for the instance i-08857c414bff91648 after which the instance became unresponsive and you need to manually stop start the instance to bring it up and running.  For this issue I checked the CPU Utilization for the Instance and could see that the CPU Utilization was quite low during the same timestamp when a high load average was experienced. [2]  Please allow me explain about the load average and its relation with CPU Utilization  In Linux, the load average is basically the combination of threads running on the CPU, threads waiting in the run queue to get on the CPU and process waiting for IO to complete. The three numbers in the load average is the average of these parameters over 1, 5 and 15 minute respectively.  Whereas the CPU utilization is basically an indication that how much percentage of time in a given time interval the CPU was busy doing some work.  So, considering above definition, it can be interpreted that we can have high load average even when CPU utilization of the server is low.",9/17/2020 0:00,9/17/2020 0:00,RE:[CASE 7393100151] Chat: Instance went unhealthy,1,,hello sujai warm greeting aws premium support sunny wa pleasure assist chat today posting quick summary chat today case note understand seeing high load average value instance instance became unresponsive need manually stop start instance bring running checked instance using internal tool could see instance failed system status check upon checking issue confirm underlying hardware instance wa running became unavailable timestamp instance failed system status check confirm underlying hardware became available instance started passing status check wa running healthy moving see attached screenshot experiencing high load average instance instance became unresponsive need manually stop start instance bring running issue checked utilization instance could see utilization wa quite low timestamp high load average wa experienced please allow explain load average relation utilization linux load average basically combination thread running thread waiting run queue get process waiting complete three number load average average parameter minute respectively whereas utilization basically indication much percentage time given time interval wa busy work considering definition interpreted high load average even utilization server low,9,pleasure premium inconvenience underlying feel contacting hope happy conversation chatting corner incoming reviewed star rated experience ahead rating assisting talking

Also the resource utilization on the EC2 instances and underlying host did not show any high utilization.  So I tried to replicate a scenario with ECR repositories in us-east-1 region and EC2 instances in ap-southeast-1 region and could pull the images upto 150 MB in around 5 - 7 secs.  You were able to confirm that you did not find any issues and could pull ECR images in considerably less time in subsequent tests.  So to conclude, I would request you to capture the traffic out from the source EC2 instance using tcptraceroute, mtr and packet captures using tcpdump if issue reoccurs as this which will help us to investigate further.  Hope this helps.  We value your feedback. Please share your experience by rating this correspondence using the AWS Support Center link at the end of this correspondence.

From what I understand, you have faced exceptions when connecting to your Redis cluster mode disabled cluster (Replication group ID: snd-dp-session) from your client (EC2 Instance ID: i-00f702c0823542167).   Thank you from providing the snippet of logs showing the exception stack traces. From it, I can see that there were two issues:   - On 2020-09-13 at 15:22 UTC, the client was not able to connect to the Redis cluster and was throwing an exception ""java.net.UnknownHostException: storefront-p-sid-redis-read.swiggyint.in"".    This error means that the application was unable to resolve the DNS name ""storefront-p-sid-redis-read.swiggyint.in"" at that time.     Depending on which endpoint is being used in the application to reach the cluster (reader, node, primary endpoints), changes in the cluster can result in the application temporarily being unable to resolve the endpoint [1]. Additionally, if the client has a DNS caching mechanism built in, it is recommended to have a lower TTL (as low as 510 seconds) as having a higher TTL poses a risk of your application not reaching the desired node. It is also recommended to not use the cache forever option.     - On 2020-09-17 from 11:00 - 12:20 UTC, the application was unable to connect to the cluster and throwing an exception ""JedisConnectionException: java.net.SocketException: Too many open files"".   This error means that the application reached the maximum number of open files (connections) allowed on the operating system (ulimit) and due to this, any additional connections past that were closed. I have found additional information from the Redis cluster that enforce these findings.   I first checked the EC2 instance for the timeframe indicated (from 2020-09-13 at 00:00 UTC to 2020-09-17 at 23:59 UTC) and I can confirm that it has been running, passing all health checks and that there were no issues with its underlying hardware nor any networking issues nor DNS issues that c",9/21/2020 0:00,9/21/2020 0:00,RE:[CASE 7404657151] Exceptions Connecting to Elasticache (snd-dp-session),2,"storefront-p-sid-redis-read.swiggyint.in,storefront-p-sid-redis-read.swiggyint.in",welcome aws premium support maureen assisting case understand faced exception connecting redis cluster mode disabled cluster replication group client ec2 instance thank providing snippet log showing exception stack trace see two issue client wa able connect redis cluster wa throwing exception error mean application wa unable resolve dns name time depending endpoint used application reach cluster reader node primary endpoint change cluster result application temporarily unable resolve endpoint additionally client ha dns caching mechanism built recommended lower low second higher pose risk application reaching desired node also recommended use cache forever option application wa unable connect cluster throwing exception jedisconnectionexception many open file error mean application reached maximum number open file connection allowed operating system ulimit due additional connection past closed found additional information redis cluster enforce finding first checked ec2 instance timeframe indicated confirm ha running passing health check issue underlying hardware networking issue dns issue,9,pleasure premium inconvenience underlying feel contacting hope happy conversation chatting corner incoming reviewed star rated experience ahead rating assisting talking
7248,7414135181,Edelweiss Financial Services Ltd,Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2 - Linux),APAC,INDIA,gamrutha,"Hello Vinayak,  Thanks for reaching AWS Premium Support. This is Amrutha and it was nice speaking to you. Let me quickly recap of what we discussed.  You initiated the chat as your EC2 instance 'i-06dbb9111eb25bbbe' status checks were getting stuck automatically at times and you wanted assistance on the same.   I did a quick check on the instance and observed that the underlying hardware on which the instance is running was healthy [1]. However, instance was failing its instance status check on 2020-09-22 15:33:00 UTC [2].  As informed on the call, Instance status checks monitor the software and network configuration of your individual instance. These checks detect problems that require your involvement to repair. When an instance status check fails, you typically must address the problem yourself (for example, by rebooting the instance or by making instance configuration changes) [3], as AWS Support Engineers do not have access to customer data..   Further, I reviewed CPU utilization, Network usage in and out and their values are also well below any values that would be of concerns. However, on checking the EBS root volume attached to the instance, I observed that the volume was driving around ~3000 iops constantly on 22-Sep-2020 from ~14:44 UTC to ~15:14 UTC due to which the volume burst balance [4] depleted to zero and performance was hampered. This can be a possible cause for the instance to fail its instance status check.  Detailed Explanation: -----------------------------------  Firstly, I would like to give you the brief idea about the IOPS. For an EBS volume, the number of IOPS that you will get is calculated using formula  -> IOPS(Input Output Per Second) = Read Operations Per Second + Write Operations Per Second -> ""IOPS on GP2 volume = Volume Size in GB * 3"",    minimum of 100 IOPS irrespective of the volume size.   Let's consider the volume of size 50GB, then the number of IOPS that you will get is 150 IOPS. The GP2 volume comes with the Burst balance concept. It means that when your volume drives a",9/23/2020 0:00,9/23/2020 0:00,RE:[CASE 7414135181] Call: EC2 Instance stuck again and again,3,,hello vinayak thanks reaching aws premium support amrutha wa nice speaking let quickly recap discussed initiated chat ec2 instance status check getting stuck automatically time wanted assistance quick check instance observed underlying hardware instance running wa healthy however instance wa failing instance status check informed call instance status check monitor software network configuration individual instance check detect problem require involvement repair instance status check fails typically must address problem example rebooting instance making instance configuration change aws support engineer access customer data reviewed utilization network usage value also well value would concern however checking eb root volume attached instance observed volume wa driving around iop constantly due volume burst balance depleted zero performance wa hampered possible cause instance fail instance status check detailed explanation firstly would like give brief idea iop eb volume number iop get calculated using formula iop input output per second read operation per second write operation per second iop volume volume size minimum iop irrespective volume size let consider volume size number iop get iop volume come burst balance concept mean volume drive,9,pleasure premium inconvenience underlying feel contacting hope happy conversation chatting corner incoming reviewed star rated experience ahead rating assisting talking
7277,7418807951,Hotstar (Star TV India),Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2 - Linux),APAC,INDIA,nndmn,"Hello,  It was really nice talking to you.  Here is the summary of our call:  You reached out today as you observed errors in the autoscaling group where Auto scaling group ""HS-Imp-ASG"" failed to launch instance.  I would like to thank you for sharing the screen shots it helped to look into the errors.  Using internal tools, I checked the auto scaling group and noticed that the instances were unable to launch between 2020-09-23 13:09 UTC and 2020-09-23 13:18 UTC. From the error messages it can be seen that there was no Spot capacity available in the region for c5.4xlarge instance type. This is the expected behavior from the Auto scaling group where launch configuration is being used with just spot instances and one instance type. Auto scaling group will keep trying to launch c5.4xlarge instances until it successfully does. I can see the launch configuration was later modified and on-demand instances were launched. Please note that there is no direct way to find out how much spot capacity is available in the region. We do have a tool called Spot advisor which shows the instance types with less interruption percentage.  https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/spot/instance-advisor/  Now to efficiently manage the auto scaling group I would like to make some recommendations. You can use Launch template instead of using launch configuration. With launch template you get the Purchase options where you can specify different instance types and ratio of On-demand Instances and Spot instances.  With this you can control the number of on-demand instances and spot instances running at any time. In a case where spot instance is not available, production environment will still be up and running with on-demand instances spread across the availability zones. It is also easy to switch to Launch template. You can edit the auto scaling group and click on switch to Launch template.

I understand you would like to find out if PostgreSQL12 is supported on Amazon Linux.  Currently PostgreSQL12 repositories have not been added to the Amazon Linux AMIs and instances and as such you will need to add the repos manually before you are able to install PostgressSQL12. To install PostgressSQL on my Amazon Linux 2 instance I followed the instructions below -:  1. Since Postgress rpms are found in the amazon extras repo I ran ""sudo  amazon-linux-extras | grep postgre"" to check and found only PostgreSQL9, 10 and 11. 2. Created the Postgress12 repo by creating a file /etc/yum.repos.d/pgsql12.repo and added the contents outlined below    [pgdg12]    name=PostgreSQL 12 for RHEL/CentOS 7 - x86_64    baseurl=https://download.postgresql.org/pub/repos/yum/12/redhat/rhel-7-x86_64    enabled=1    gpgcheck=0 3. Once the repo was added I was able to install the PostgreSQL server and client packages by running ""sudo yum install postgresql12 postgresql12-server"" 4. I then was able to initialize the database, enable it and start it without any issues.  Please use the above steps to set up the PostgreSQL12 repos and you will be able to install it on Amazon Linux 2.

The error you received does not correlate with your AMI. If you try to launch any t2.xlarge instance instance into the ap-south-1c availability zone, it will give the same error.

Open the AWS EC2 Console in the region you want to launch the instance in.  2. Click on Instance Types from the left side menu 3. You will get a table of all instance types. Type in t2.xlarge into the search bar 4. Click on t2.xlarge blue hyperlink to open the page for that instance type 5. Scroll down to the Networking tab. You will have a section called Availability Zones. This will tell you which zones the instance is available to launch in.    ACTION PLAN ########### To get past this error, you must choose a different combination of instance type - availability zone. You do not have to change both instance type and availability zone - one of them is good enough.   To change availability Zone -   1.

7368,7441718491,Dream11 Fantasy Private Limited,Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2 - Linux),APAC,INDIA,saskk,"Hello Harsimran Singh,  Thanks for reaching AWS Premium Support. Myself Sasikumar from AWS EC2 Linux team, and I am glad to assist you today.  I understand that you have found discrepancy between the data shown in the CloudWatch CPU metric and the data shown from the other tools such as New Relic, Elasticvue and OS level 'top' command. You are concerned about the data and you are facing difficulty in the capacity planning. Please correct me if I misunderstood your problem.  First, I appreciate you for providing a clear problem statement and relevant screenshot outputs.  The CloudWatch metrics for the CPU utilization are derived from the Hypervisor showing how much the instance is using and as such this is the recommended metric for the actual usage of the CPU from your instance compared to the other tools.  The CPUUtilization metric reported via CloudWatch is from the underlying host perspective and may not always match OS provided tools and the third-party monitoring tools. The CPUUtilization in CloudWatch displays the percentage of allocated EC2 compute units that are currently in use by the instance. The OS will report based on how many CPU cycles it is using from the underlying host. As the host will have other workloads running, the CloudWatch metrics provide a true insight into the actual CPU usage of the instance compared to the total allocated CPU from the host. The CloudWatch metric identifies the processing power required to run an application on a selected instance. Refer[1].  Linux 'top' utility will show you the CPU utilization of the underlying host whereas CloudWatch will show you the CPU utilization of your actual instance. This is why you will see large differences.

It was nice talking to you today.? I hope you are doing great!   You initiated a chat as you were unable to launch the instance i-056c17d6daf1e9306 in ap-south-1 region and wanted to know what could be the issue.  I have reviewed the backend log and noticed that there was not enough capacity available at that moment for On-Demand capacity to complete your request. However after few seconds the capacity space came back and you were able to launch the instance.  I am really sorry for the inconvenience this issue is causing you.  ? Unfortunately, capacity is not guaranteed as customer demand keeps changing unless you have an existing On-Demand Capacity Reservation for your Ec2 instances. By creating Capacity Reservations, you will ensure that you will always have access to your EC2 capacity when you need it, for as long as you need it.  If in future you face similar kind of issues then please try the following:   - Wait a few minutes and then submit your request again; capacity can shift frequently.   - Try changing the instance type for time being and revert to desired instance type, when capacity is available( Which you has done recently)   - For a long term solution, please consider using On-Demand Capacity reservation which enables you to reserve Amazon EC2 capacity for any duration. For more information, see On-Demand Capacity Reservations.     https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-capacity-reservations.html  On-Demand Capacity Reservations enable you to reserve capacity for your Amazon EC2 instances in a specific Availability Zone for any duration.

7389,7449366601,Dream11 Fantasy Private Limited,Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2 - Linux),APAC,INDIA,kpvani,"Hello Nandeesh,  Thank you for your time over chat. It was pleasure to have worked with you.   This is a summary of our chat session.  You had reached out regarding instance: i-053df7fd8bf533ff4 failing its 1/2 status checks intermittently and getting fixed on every stop start.  On checking we found that the issue was with the attached root volume: vol-036b9d19ca718b7fd depleting its burstbalance to 0 and hence freezing the volume after that.  The burst balance [1] of your EBS instance was getting depleted and was reduced to zero which means a lot of read and write operations were being done. Depletion of burst balance hinders performance and only GP2 EBS volumes have the concept of burst balance. This goes hand in hand with the size of the volume as well. The volume size determines the baseline performance level of the volume and how quickly it accumulates I/O credits; larger volumes have higher baseline performance levels and accumulate I/O credits faster. Volumes earn I/O credits at the baseline performance rate of 3 IOPS per GiB of volume size. For example, a 100 GiB gp2 volume has a baseline performance of 300 IOPS. However, all volumes with 33.33 GiB and below have a minimum baseline performance of 100 IOPS.  Now since your volume size is 50 GiB, the baseline for your volume is 150 IOPS. As soon as you start to operate above this 150 IOPS mark, you would be utilizing your burst balance. Once the burst balance depletes completely and reaches 0, your IOPS will be throttled. In your case, the volume went above 3000 IOPS [2] [3]. This caused it to go above the baseline (150 IOPS for 50 GiB) as a result of which burst balance was depleted and was reduced to zero which resulted in the instance getting stuck because application was pushing more than baseline IOPS(150 IOPS) even after zero burst-balance. Further, once the instance was stop-started again, the burst balance was restored and instance became reachable again.   Thus, to ensure proper performance of the EBS volume and prevent burst balance depletion, I ",10/2/2020 0:00,10/2/2020 0:00,RE:[CASE 7449366601] Chat: Instance Status Checks failing on i-053df7fd8bf533ff4,2,,hello nandeesh thank time chat wa pleasure worked summary chat session reached regarding instance failing status check intermittently getting fixed every stop start checking found issue wa attached root volume depleting burstbalance hence freezing volume burst balance eb instance wa getting depleted wa reduced zero mean lot read write operation done depletion burst balance hinders performance eb volume concept burst balance go hand hand size volume well volume size determines baseline performance level volume quickly accumulates credit larger volume higher baseline performance level accumulate credit faster volume earn credit baseline performance rate iop per volume size example volume ha baseline performance iop however volume minimum baseline performance iop since volume size baseline volume iop soon start operate iop mark would utilizing burst balance burst balance depletes completely reach iop throttled case volume went iop caused baseline iop result burst balance wa depleted wa reduced zero resulted instance getting stuck application wa pushing baseline iop iop even zero burst balance instance wa stop started burst balance wa restored instance became reachable thus ensure proper performance eb volume prevent burst balance depletion,9,pleasure premium inconvenience underlying feel contacting hope happy conversation chatting corner incoming reviewed star rated experience ahead rating assisting talking

It was a pleasure working with you.  While on the call/chime screenshare we went through the reason the instance i-06e7dcd54f70238b1 was going into a stopped state right after launching as well as the new ami taken also having issues launching.  This was due to an access denied error on the CreateGrant API call due to:  errorCode   AccessDenied errorMessage   User: arn:aws:sts::997200155612:assumed-role/techm_iam_role_application_engineer/MP00636420@TechMahindra.com is not authorized to perform: kms:CreateGrant on resource: arn:aws:kms:ap-south-1:997200155612:key/5d55923a-7960-4782-aef1-e8c4b57680d4   This meant the role did not have permissions in order to use the key that the EBS Volume was encrypted with. Your colleague Sathya had changed the permissions on the KMS key to allow the role to access the KMS key that the EBS root volume was protected by.  After this was done the instance was able to be launched in a new subnet as desired. Next we attempted to connect with the openvpn client which was throwing a few errors as TLS key negotiation failed[1]. I had a suspicion the client config needed to be updated to point to the new Elastic IP attached to the newly launched instance i-07d2c1465be932123 which was confirmed on the client configs still pointing to vpn.zee5.com and not updated in the client config. After a new entry was made in the client configs to point to the elastic IP it was working as intended.  Next we went ahead to update the DNS entry for vpn-stg.zee5.com on Azure. Then we tested it out to verify the client config could be used for connecting to the staging vpn.  After this was done we went ahead to update the vpn load balancer in order to use the staging server instead of the currently unhealthy i-06e7dcd54f70238b1.

My name is Neha and I will be assisting you on this case.  I understand the instance i-078302c4cfc00a439  was unavailable between  02 Oct 2020, 18:00 Hrs to 03 Oct 2020 16:00 Hrs.  I did review the instance metrics and could see the instance was failing its Instance level status checks(StatusCheckFailed_Instances[1]) between 2020-10-02 around 12:29 to 2020-10-03 around 10:39 UTC, but was passing its System level Status checks(StatusCheckFailed_System [2]).The CPUUtilization[3] of the instance was also within limits during the above time frame.Investigating the EBS metrics for the volumes I could see the volumes working as expected.  I did review the underlying hardware of the instance and it is currently healthy and does not show any packet loss. Since the instance started passing its status check after a stop/start the console logs also do not show any errors. From the above metrics it seems there was no AWS infrastructure related issues that could have caused the instance to fail its status check and we would have to further troubleshoot the issue from the Operating System level/application level.   There are several reason a instance may fail its Instance level status checks as mentioned in document [4], memory level congestion being one of them.You can identify if the system is running low on memory using the 'free -m' command.Also, consider analyzing or providing the OS level logs during the above time frame to identify any issue at the OS level that may have caused the instance status check to fail.The Os level logs are generally located under /var/log. Reviewing the AMI, it seems its an amazon linux based AMI and the log files to reviewed during the above time frame are   /var/log/messages /var/log/dmesg /var/log/boot.log  Further, if you are not already using, you may also consider using ""atop"" so as to determine if the instance is running into any resource level congestion.

I have reviewed the instances i-0157a555aee0bfae8 and i-0ddc5ffc207080fc5, and understand that you have rebooted then around 03:40AM UTC of October 07th. The Operating System got stuck during the boot process and only completed the boot after you stop/start the instances. Please correct if I am wrong.  The user-data script execution apparently stopped during the restart of the codedeploy agent. I would need to review the logs from the agent to see if we can confirm an issue with it. However, it is important to mention that your instance are running Red Hat 6, which is not officially supported to run the codedeploy agent[1]. It is not possible to guarantee that a fix will be provided if confirmed an issue caused by Operating System incompatibility.  In order to isolate the issue and narrow down the investigation I would like to ask a few questions and suggest some tests: - By default, user-data scripts only run on the first boot after the instance launch. Your instances were configured to execute a relatively extensive script at every boot. Why do you need all those routines to be executed during the boot? - I haven't identified any modification on the CodeDeploy agent configuration, why do you need to restart it at the end of every boot? - Your instances have the SSM agent running and online, have you considered moving some of your user-data routines to Systems Manager? Among other advantages, Systems Manager provides the State Manger feature that is a secure and scalable service way to keeping your EC2 instances in a state that you define.[2]   - Please update your user-data script and temporarily remove the ""service codedeploy-agent restart"" command. - Reboot your instances a few times and see if the problem is resolved. - If confirmed that the issue is caused by the codedeploy agent, reproduce the issue again, collect the logs in  /var/log/aws/codedeploy-agent and provide them for review.

You were looking into ways to work around the issues you were having with launching your instances in us-east-1f.  The error you are getting is what we call an Insufficient Capacity Error (ICE for short)[1], and simply means that the instance type you are trying to launch is simply not readily available within the AZ you are trying to launch it in. As a note to make as well, this has nothing to do with the limits on your account or otherwise any normal settings there within. The doc reference prior has steps you can take to try and mitigate this, but of the options you initially noted simply avoiding that AZ would be one of them. There are other ways to help ensure availability in this zone should you wish to stay in it as well, such as reserved instances[2] or capacity reservations[3], which may fit your use case as well.

It was nice having a chat session with you today, and here I would like to share the summary of our conversation.  As per the discussion, your clients are trying to access the application which is running on the EC2 Instance i-07843388432fb943d over its Public IP address 3.1.98.104, but they are unable to connect. Hence you wanted to know if there is any blockage on this Instance which may be causing the issue. Hence needed our assistance regarding the same.  As you mentioned that the clients are trying to access the application which is on the Ec2 Instance over 443(HTTPS). Therefore, using our internal tools, I checked the Security groups of this Instance from my side and was able to see that port 443 for open to all IPv4 addresses in the Inbound rules of SG sg-051ab7ee24a040dd4. Also, I couldn't see any restriction in the Outbound rules of the same. Moreover, I checked the Network ACL rules of this Instance and was able to see that you have blocked some IPs in the Inbound rules, rest of all the IPs are allowed. Also, there was no restriction in the Outbound rules in NACL.   Moving further I checked the route table of this Instance and was able to see that it was having Internet gateway which is allowing all traffic. Also, you mentioned that the firewall within the Debian based Instance is disabled.  I tried to check the connectivity over 443 to the Instance IP address using telnet command from the local machine and below is the result of the same;  --- # telnet  3.1.98.104 443 Trying 3.1.98.104...

My name is Philip and I will assist you with this case.  I understand that you would like to set IST as the default timezone for all new EC2 instance launches.  EC2 instances in all regions launch with UTC as their timezone. You may change the timezone setting during launch with a User Data [1] bash script with the timedatectl command [2]. Please view my example script below. To launch an instance with this script you need to define it on the ""Configure Instance"" step of the launch wizard, or alternatively in the launch template that you intend to use.  In the instance launch wizard, step 3 ""Configure Instance"" contains a User Data field. For Launch Templates, the User Data field is in the ""Advanced details"" section of the Create Launch Template form.  I have tested this script to successfully change the timezone to IST on     # Amazon Linux 2   # RHEL 7.6   # RHEL 8   # Ubuntu 20.04 LTS  in the ap-south-1 region.  To test this, copy and paste all the text between the dashed lines, into the User Data field as described above.  ------------------------- Content-Type: multipart/mixed; boundary=""//"" MIME-Version: 1.0  --// Content-Type: text/cloud-config; charset=""us-ascii"" MIME-Version: 1.0 Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit Content-Disposition: attachment; filename=""cloud-config.txt""  #cloud-config cloud_final_modules: - [scripts-user, once]  --// Content-Type: text/x-shellscript; charset=""us-ascii"" MIME-Version: 1.0 Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit Content-Disposition: attachment; filename=""userdata.txt""  #!/bin/bash timedatectl status timedatectl set-timezone 'Asia/Kolkata' timedatectl status -------------------------  To check the time, and time zone on your instance, you can run     $ timedatectl status  If you have any further questions or queries, you are welcome to reply to to this case, or to initiate a chat or call from within this case.

This is Abhishek here and I am glad to assist you with this case.  From the case correspondence, i understand that one of the instance is having a spikes in memory utilisation on the instance and you would like to know the reason behind it.  Please correct me if my understanding of the issue is not accurate.  Thank you for providing the instance id i-0f4eea456c0321ecd. Using internal tools i confirm that this instance is of t2.micro (x86_64) which has 1 vCPU and 1.0 GiB memory. Using internal tools i confirm that the instance is running with the CentOS 7.   Before proceeding further according to Data Privacy Policy [1], AWS engineers are not allowed to directly access customer's instance/data since data privacy and security is our top priority.  Hence, we do not have the access to the memory utilization details of the instance and I wont be able to check inside the Instance about what caused the memory to exhaust.   To start understand the issue, please provide us the exact timing when you saw the memory spikes. A screenshot of these graphs will be a great help. These timestamps will help us relate these memory usage with other components like CPU and Volume IO.  Please run the below commands when you see the high memory usage in the graphs, to check the current memory usage during the time of issue  # cat /proc/meminfo # free -k # vmstat # top -o %MEM -b -n 10 > /tmp/topresult  Run the above command and attach the /tmp/topresult file.  To check, which process taking memory over a period of time we need to install monitoring tool like ""sar"" which will give us more info.  SAR is a system activity report provided by the ""sysstat"" package [1].  If it is already installed and running please get us the, below sar report files,  where sar15 and sar 16 are for values on October 15th and 16th, 2020 respectively.  # /var/log/sa/sar15 # /var/log/sa/sar16  If you could not find those files, then try running these # sar -r -f /var/log/sa/sa15 # s",10/16/2020 0:00,10/16/2020 0:00,RE:[CASE 7498101911] Instance consuming too much free memory,3,,hello greeting day thank contacting aws premium support abhishek glad assist case case correspondence understand one instance spike memory utilisation instance would like know reason behind please correct understanding issue accurate thank providing instance using internal tool confirm instance ha vcpu memory using internal tool confirm instance running centos proceeding according data privacy policy aws engineer allowed directly access customer instance data since data privacy security top priority hence access memory utilization detail instance wont able check inside instance caused memory exhaust start understand issue please provide exact timing saw memory spike screenshot graph great help timestamps help relate memory usage component like volume please run command see high memory usage graph check current memory usage time issue cat free vmstat top run command attach file check process taking memory period time need install monitoring tool like give info system activity report provided sysstat package already installed running please get report file value october respectively could find file try running,9,pleasure premium inconvenience underlying feel contacting hope happy conversation chatting corner incoming reviewed star rated experience ahead rating assisting talking

Here is a recap of our call/screenshare.  Today you reached out to us because you were unable to reach yum repository on instance i-070fefb25630d1485  From our troubleshooting session today, we found that you are unable to reach the yum repositories.  When you tried doing command 'telnet subscription.rhn.redhat.com 443' it showed that the domain 'subscription.rhn.redhat.com' was correctly resolved to IP 209.132.183.107 but it failed/timeout to establish the connection which leads me to believe that your VPN/Proxy doesn't allow the connection.   Sample of the output you got:    # telnet subscription.rhn.redhat.com 443   Trying 209.132.183.107...  We also checked the following and there was nothing that could account for the issue you are experiencing:   - yum configuration  - no firewall running on the instance  - SELinux   - security group   - sg-0c58ce7ae5a4d6758   - you had network connectivity as you successfully executed command 'wget google.com'  As I can see you are using transit gateway 'tgw-0a5bd66421d35e9e1' for internet connectivity on your RouteTable 'rtb-05a31ca2edc717983' I would recommend checking with your networking team to make sure that the RHEL endpoints can be reached.  Lastly, from the output you provided from the yum log, we saw that you also need to configure the proxy settings in your instance   https://access.redhat.com/solutions/65300    2020-10-20T11:17:43Z DEBUG error: Curl error (51): SSL peer certificate or SSH remote key was not OK for https://rhui3.ap-south-1.aws.ce.redhat.com/pulp/mirror/protected/rhui-client-config/rhel/server/8/x86_64/os [SSL: no alternative certificate subject name matches target host name '185.46.212.88'] (https://rhui3.ap-south-1.aws.ce.redhat.com/pulp/mirror/protected/rhui-client-config/rhel/server/8/x86_64/os).

It was a pleasure talking with you on call  a moment ago.  You reached out to us today as you were not able to curl to your http end point hosted on instance ID 'i-0e2b8f26fdb3e948b'  from an Azure Machine on a public subnet.  During our call, you mentioned that you were able to reach the endpoint on your production instance 'i-0c9e50e3f3386cabc ' and not staging 'i-0e2b8f26fdb3e948b'.  1. The working instance  'i-0c9e50e3f3386cabc '  is on a public subnet with a public IP '13.232.17.25' and running a telnet from Azure instance was successful as below:    [z5adminroot@test-searchproject ~]$ telnet 13.232.17.25 80  Trying 13.232.17.25...  Connected to 13.232.17.25.  Escape character is '^]'.    As mentioned subnet is public if it has a default route pointing to an Internet Gateway. In this way, any EC2 instances from the public subnet can access the Internet and can be reached from internet based on security group rules.   2. The second instance ID 'i-0e2b8f26fdb3e948b' which is staging is on a private subnet and therefore will not be reachable from the public subnet for Azure as explained.

You opened a chat with us today as you were still experiencing issues with your instance not appearing as managed by SSM.  While on the chat with you I was able to take a look at the instance and I had a look over the document you provided with the screenshots. From the document I was able to see that when you executed the following command:  Invoke-RestMethod ""http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/iam/info""  You received an error message which you confirmed I asked you to connect to the instance and try to access 169.254.169.254 from the browser within your instance. You were unable to successfully connect to the IP from your browser.  We decided to go on screenshare together so that I could see the errors and better guide you in resolving the issue. I asked you to run the command route print so I could check the routes configured on your instance from here I was able to see that the routes were incorrectly configured.  The routes you had for the following IP's 169.254.169.251, 169.254.169.250 and 169.254.169.254 were pointing to the gateway address 10.160.17.1 were as your actual gate way is 10.160.16.1. We tried to modify the routes using the Script Add-Routes.ps1 unfortunately the script was not correctly executing so we had to manually modify the routes.  We used the following command to modify the routes to remove the incorrect routes and add the correct routes back in.  route DELETE 169.254.169.251 route DELETE 169.254.169.250 route DELETE 169.254.169.254  route -p ADD 169.254.169.254 MASK 255.255.255.0 10.160.16.1 route -p ADD 169.254.169.251 MASK 255.255.255.0 10.160.16.1 route -p ADD 169.254.169.250 MASK 255.255.255.0 10.160.16.1  After we did this you were able to successfully access 169.254.169.254 from your browser we then restarted the SSM agent service and saw the instance now appearing as managed by SSM.

7674,7537499181,Mylan,Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2 - Linux),APAC,INDIA,joelking,"Hello Mitch,  Welcome to AWS Support, my name is Joel.  From the case details, I see that when you filter under ""Owned by me"" in the AMIs page of the EC2 console, you get a ""Read timed out"" error.  What you are experiencing is a known issue that can occur when an account has several thousands of AMIs. Viewing your AMIs, at the time of writing, you have 39,787 in your US-EAST-1 Region.  I completely understand how frustrating this issue is. The most recent update I see is that the EC2 User Experience team is working on a fix, and at this time AWS Support doesn't have an ETA to share. I will push for another update and add your case and sentiment.  In the meanwhile, a workaround would be to use the AWS CLI to retrieve the AMIs you're looking for. For example:  Filtering for AMIs with names starting with Digital*: $ aws ec2 describe-images --owners self --query 'Images[].{Name:Name,ImageID:ImageId}' --filters Name=name,Values=Digital* --cli-read-timeout 0  Filtering for AMIs with names starting with Splunk*: $ aws ec2 describe-images --owners self --query 'Images[].{Name:Name,ImageID:ImageId}' --filters Name=name,Values=Splunk* --cli-read-timeout 0  Please note that filter values (e.g., ""Digital"") are case sensitive.  I've also attached two txt files to the case (describe-images-Digital.txt, describe-images-Splunk.txt) with the output of the above read-only commands - I hope this can help a little bit.  I'll update you again when I hear back from the internal team.

7676,7538253611,ALL_DEPRECATED,Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2 - Linux),APAC,INDIA,yufeica,"Hi Leon,  Thanks for your time on the chat, it's great to see that you've managed to restore the instance.  Following is a short summary about what we've discussed:  A. The instance health check issue with i-0dd0d422e9e4fccc0 -- The issue with the instance i-0dd0d422e9e4fccc0 failed to boot is that, the instance has additional EBS volume /dev/sdg (volume ID vol-095047021645f3890), the volume /dev/sdg also has root partition configured, so when the instance is rebooting, there are 2 volumes presenting as root : /dev/xvda and /dev/sdg. Although /dev/xvda is perfectly fine, the instance might randomly pick one root to boot from, since the root in /dev/sdg does not have proper network configuration, the instance could not start its network stack, hence the instance failed the health check. The issue was fixed by Stop/Start the instance (and luckily the OS booted from /dev/xvda this time around). -- In future, if the instance is rebooted again, the same issue may happen again, when that happens, Stop/Start the instance a few times will eventually let the instance boot from the right root. -- In a longer term, removing the duplicate root from /dev/sdg will be the permanent fix.  B. The instance health check issue with i-0fd295e7a31df960e -- From the instance console log, it appears the instance runs out of space. Once the root volume of the instance has space increased, the instance was able to pass health check in next Stop/Start.  C. The upgrade path for DLAMI -- For instances running DLAMI, the recommended path of upgrading is to launch a new instance with latest DLAMI, then move the EBS volumes from old DLAMI to new one. More details can be found in this link: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/dlami/latest/devguide/upgrading-dlami.html  Please let us know if you need further assistance. Have a good evening!

7690,7546203531,TataSky Ltd,Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2 - Linux),APAC,INDIA,jhelios,"Greetings Revanth,   I've checked the EFS resources (I wasn't positive which one was attached to the instance, so I went ahead and checked all 4) as well, and do not see any performance bottleneck occurring.    To restate from the chat, we've checked EBS metrics, CPU Utilization, and now EFS metrics and do not see any performance bottlenecks occurring at the times mentioned. Additionally, I've checked the NetworkIn and Out metrics,and while there's a fair amount of traffic occurring around 0300-0400 UTC, this is not during the time allotted, nor does it follow hte ""slowly become unresponsive after a reboot"" behavior we are seeing.   That brings me to the following. There are a couple things that I do not have access to that we can check, so I would therefore need your assistance. We can check the dmesg and /var/log/messages log, as well as any memory statistics.   1. Logs:   I've attached an S3 bucket to this case, the link is at the end of the correspondence. We would want to check the dmesg log and messages for any possible errors or log entries that would direct us to the cause of this slowness. Also, if the users are accessing the instance through any sort of program or application, those application logs would be useful as well.    In short, the logs we would be looking for would be dmesg, messages, and application logs. The commands to provide them and locations are noted below:   For dmesg:   $ dmesg   - Will print out the log.   Also located in /var/log/boot.log    For Messages:   'journalctl' will print out the current syslog, and although it is slightly different than the messages log it should still contain all the details.

I am writing to give you a summary of our chat.  After you tried the first and second options as our documentation [1], you were not still able to launch your EC2 instances. I advised that you should try to change the instance type as the third option. However, R4 instance types belong to Xen platform, you needed to change the instance type to Nitro-based.  Having said that, I recommended this AWS knowledge center article, Why is my Linux instance not booting after I changed its type to a Nitro-based instance type? - https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/boot-error-linux-nitro-instance/.  Here are some instance types that you can use instead of r4.8xlarge [2]:   Instance   vCPU Memory (GiB) Instance Storage (GiB) Networking Performance (Gbps) EBS Bandwidth (Mbps)  r5.8xlarge  32  256    EBS-Only    10        6,800  r5a.8xlarge  32  256    EBS-Only    Up to 10      4,750  r5n.8xlarge  32  256    EBS-Only    25        6,800  As agreed, I will be marking the case resolved.

As per your message I understand you're running into ""RequestLimitExceeded"" error when calling the DescribeInstances operation.   I reached out to the Service team with the api limit increase request. However, the Service team have responded and advised that when you're been affected by throttled API calls,  we first require for you to put measures in place like an 'exponential backoff' logic to your applications and only after measures have been taken then would a limit increase be considered by ourinternal team, but do note that this is not guaranteed.   This policy was created in order to be able to provide a reliable service which prevents a single customer from affecting other customers inside our infrastructure:  https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/api-retries.html  Thus, Your best bet to resolve throttling entirely is to spread your calls out over a longer period, instead of making almost all of them in the same second.  I have located a blog on Exponential Backoff And Jitter which you may find useful here:   https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/architecture/exponential-backoff-and-jitter/ https://www.baeldung.com/resilience4j-backoff-jitter  Once the recommendations are implemented, please let me know if you still face the errors and rest assured I can further investigate.

7772,7572826031,Play Games 24x7 Pvt. Ltd,Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2 - Linux),APAC,INDIA,rakshc,"Hi Vivek,  Thank you for your valuable time on chat today. Please find a brief summary of our discussion below:  You reached out to us as you were unable to launch r4.8xlarge, m4.10xlarge and r4.4xlarge instance types in ap-south-1c. I informed that these instance types are not supported in ap-south-1c. I also mentioned that you can get a list of all supported instance types in an AZ by running: ""describe-instance-type-offerings"" command. On running the command, you found that ap-south-1c supports only nitro based instances and you need to launch either r4.4xlarge or similar instance type in ap-south-1c AZ only .   I informed you that r5 provides better performance than r4 and it is supported in ap-south-1c, so you may consider launching r5 instead of r4 (if your application allows). You mentioned that the AMI is an old AMI and hence, I suspected that the AMI may not have required drivers for nitro based instances. I added that, since ap-south-1c does not support r4.4xlarge there is no way to launch this instance type in ap-south-1c. Hence, you can launch r4 instance from the AMI in any other AZ and then install nvme and ena drivers on that instance (if not already present). Then, create an AMI from that instance and launch r5 instance from the new AMI in ap-south-1c AZ. However, I also mentioned that due to lack of visibility I am not sure about the configuration of AMI and hence I cannot be sure about whether the instance will come up as r5 or not.  Please accept our apologies for the trouble caused due to lack of instance type in the required Availability Zone.  Further, as discussed, I would be marking this case as resolved and in case you have any other concerns, you can always reach out to us via a new support case and we would be more than glad to assist you.

7798,7580346381,Edelweiss Financial Services Ltd,Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2 - Windows),APAC,INDIA,dmrsm,"Hi,  Looking at instance i-00dc312bdc5491481 I can see that there were no StopInstances API calls within approximately the last 24 hours.  The transition to a Stopped state was initiated from within the OS, rather than the EC2 layer, so I am unable to validate how this was performed.  Looking over the instance's CloudWatch metrics, I do not see an indication of an OS level crash. Within the last 24 hours and prior to the instance stopping, the CPU utilisation does not go above 10%, there are no failed status checks and the EBS volume metrics do not show a spike in activity I would expect from an OS crash.  At this stage I can confirm that there were no incidents of a failure or crash affecting this instance or it's underlying infrastructure.  As AWS Premium Support do not have access to data stored within the OS of customer EC2 instances, I would suggest continuing the investigation from the OS level logs. If you are able to review the event logs, these may have entries which indicate what process initiated the shutdown.  If you have any further questions, please feel free to reach out.

7824,7589804931,ALL_DEPRECATED,Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2 - Linux),APAC,INDIA,donough,"Good day,  Thank you for contacting me via chat.  You came through as you spot instance was stopped due to capacity shortage in the availability zone.  Spot Instances are spare compute capacity in the AWS Cloud. Spot Instance capacity is interrupted when Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) needs the capacity back. The no Spot capacity available error occurs when there isn't enough spare capacity to fulfill your Spot Instance or Spot Fleet request.  As capacity becomes available, Amazon EC2 fulfills requests in the following order:  * Reserved Instances * On-Demand Instances * Spot Instances  The Spot request continues to automatically make the launch request until capacity becomes available. When capacity becomes available, Amazon EC2 fulfills the Spot request. More information can be found from the following link:  Why am I receiving a ""no Spot capacity available"" error when trying to launch an Amazon EC2 Spot Instance?: https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/ec2-spot-instance-insufficient-capacity/#:~:text=Spot%20Instances%20are%20spare%20compute,Instance%20or%20Spot%20Fleet%20request.  Unfortunately the only way to guarantee that there will be capacity available for the new instance type when you require it would be to purchase reserved instances, as regular on-demand instance launches are subject to the available capacity in the Availability Zone they are requested on being enough to accommodate them at the time of the request. Further information on Reserved Instances can be found here [2].

We investigated an issue with 522 errors from https://plugins.gradle.org/m2/ and the URLs beneath it (for example, https://plugins.gradle.org/m2/com/google/cloud/tools/jib/com.google.cloud.tools.jib.gradle.plugin/1.8.0/com.google.cloud.tools.jib.gradle.plugin-1.8.0.pom) when retrieving the hosted file from the Mumbai Region.   I can confirm, through testing, that this appears specific to the Mumbai Region, as Sydney, Singapore, Northern Virginia and Ohio all were able to download the file. However, all attempts through Mumbai receive a 522 error.    Unfortunately, 522 errors occur when a TCP connection to the webserver could not be established, in this case between  Cloudflare and the Gradle webserver. This occurs when the origin web server (Gradle's) does not send a SYN+ACK within 15 seconds or acknowledge Cloudflare's resource request within 90 seconds; therefore, it cannot complete the three-way handshake required for a TCP connection.

Was my pleasure to assist you with this case. I understand that you want to know why the instnace i-0aeeada4e75dbf9d7 was terminated from the the AutoScalingGroup (ASG) CPPMLTrainingEcsClusterInfrastructure-AutoScalingGroup1-V4MO2CA1TTD0.  While I was doing the review to my back-end tools regarding to this instance i-0aeeada4e75dbf9d7 from the ASG CPPMLTrainingEcsClusterInfrastructure-AutoScalingGroup1-V4MO2CA1TTD0, I found that while this EC2 instance was being created by the Auto Scaling request, the instance was not able to pass (1 of 2 Status Checks) the Instance Status Check, and after a connection timed out for this health check it was terminated due this reason. Basically the instance was created but the instance was not released due connection time out (health check) and finally was terminated due the previous reason.  There are not more details in the logs. Sometimes the EC2 instances can take several minutes to be ready, but if the instance was not ready within the expected time and the health check is not able to confirm or validate that the instance passed or not the health check [1] grace period then produces a connection timeout error.   Regarding to your concern why this happens if you have Reserved Instances next is the best answer that can clarify this concern:  ""The Reserved Instances cant ensure availability of the resource at the exact moment when is required, but in the other hand the RI ensure the pricing of the instance when the resource is available to be used.  What I can recommend is launch a small batch of instances 3 or 5 instead 10 or 20 at the time.

Thank you for reaching out to AWS Premium Support with your question about why you are unable to access port 25 on your on-prem server(IP address of 10.60.0.124) from the ec2 instance (i-02437d04d67ba930d), port 25 has been enabled.   I can confirm that I did not see any presents of throttling on port 25 on the instance id provided, so the cause of the issue you are experiencing most likely relates to network routing.     From our tooling I was able to see that the instance had a route table entry to route traffic to the IP address of 10.60.0.124 via the gateway tgw-03e98aa985b4db57e.   From the ""mtr"" command you executed we could see that there seem to be no route to the host 10.60.0.124, this can be seen from the output below: root@ip-172-27-147-237:/var/snap # mtr -P 25  -w 10.60.0.124 HOST: ip-172-27-147-237                             Loss%   Snt   Last   Avg  Best  Wrst StDev   1.|-- ???                                           100.0    10    0.0   0.0   0.0   0.0   0.0   2.|-- 169.254.3.2                                    0.0%    10    0.9   0.9   0.8   1.6   0.3   3.|-- 169.254.187.130                                0.0%    10    1.3   1.0   0.8   1.3   0.2   4.|-- ???                                           100.0    10    0.0   0.0   0.0   0.0   0.0   5.|-- 169.254.227.1                                  0.0%    10    2.1   2.5   1.6   6.3   1.5   6.|-- ip-192-168-203-26.ap-south-1.compute.internal  0.0%    10    3.5   5.4   3.5  16.9   4.1   7.|-- ip-192-168-203-25.ap-south-1.compute.internal  0.0%    10    4.0   4.2   3.8   4.7   0.3   8.|-- ???

I understand you have issues with your EC2 instance "" i-006c78e9a1b397ac0"" which was rebooted unexpectedly today around 10:00 as I could see from the event viewer logs you shared with me.   I can see from our internal tools the System Check failed around 9:34 AM UTC. This was caused by an underling host that entered in a degraded state. I can see that the instance is now on a healthy host starting at ""Tue Nov 17 2020 10:12:00"" UTC.   Please let me explain the differences between the automatic health checks that are being performed on Amazon EC2 instances,  - StatusCheckFailed_System aka. System reachability check: It checks the underlying host used by Amazon EC2 instance  - StatusCheckFailed_Instance aka. Instance reachability check: It checks the disk status and network availability of the specific instance  Kindly mind to be alerted on the instance status, you can setup an alarm for status checks. Please follow this document to add to your instance the alert. [1] If you were concerned on how to avoid this from happening on the future, as you have Autorecovery [2] enabled Unfortunately, there is no way to ensure a 100% success rate of recovery, but in order to minimize impact I recommend to keep Autorecovery in place while, at the same time create CloudWatch alarms [3] on health check failures. To limit data loss and recover it fast, please mind to add snapshots of your EBS volumes. [4]  Since this would allow you to restore and create new volumes from them and have you data ready without any further issues. You can take snapshots automatically, please follow this document that helps you set up the automatism. [5]  Hope this is helpful, Looking forward from hearing any further queries.

My name is Tejas and I will be assisting you on this case.  I understand that you noticed the ec2 instance ""i-00fc29158bece72bc"" became unresponsive from Nov 19 14:08 to Nov 19 14:28  UTC. To resolve the issue, you rebooted the ec2 instance at 2020-11-19T14:24 UTC. I also understand that you would like to know reason which could cause unresponsiveness during impacted time frame.  I have reviewed the instance ""i-00fc29158bece72bc"" and confirmed that it was passing both status checks[1] during impacted time frame. I also review underlying hardware of ec2 instance and confirm, it was running on healthy underlying host. Additionally, I have reviewed the instance cloud watch metrics and they all seem to be working as expected. Furthermore, I review console log for any failed error message which could help us to understand issue. However, there is no log available for impacted time-frame since the console log is replaced during reboot.  Moving forward, I have review the EBS volume vol-0477bf1d7659c4d89  cloud watch metrics during impacted time frame and noticed that there were increased in VolumeReadOPS (max 800 Ops/sec).[2] I also noticed increased in qlength (32)as well as volume throughput (54 MiB/sec). Furthermore, the ec2 instance is m4.large which provides 56.25 Maximum throughput (MB/s, 128 KiB I/O).[3]  As per my understanding, the EBS volume vol-0477bf1d7659c4d89 was hitting instance level throughput limit during impacted time. Therefore, it increased qlength as well as read latency on volume. The application running on the ec2 instance could be hung because of throughput hit on instance level throughput limit. Because of this, the ec2 instance might became unresponsive during impacted time frame.  Lastly, I noticed that the ec2 instance is rebooted ""2020-11-19T14:24 UTC"". After reboot, the EBS volume metrics seem to be working as expected.

I understand that one of your production instance ""i-0dfb6e16601b0f0a1"" was taken down due to health check API failure At 2020-11-23 00:10 UTC. when you checked the cloudWatch metrics everything looked fine till 2020-11-23T00:06 UTC , but after 2020-11-23T00:06 UTC the cloudWatch metrics data is not available. Thus you are reaching out for assistance to know the possible reason behind the health check failure more in detail and why the cloudWatch metrics data is missing.  I have taken a look at the instance in the question and can confirm that there was an issue with the underlying hosting hardware that started on2020-11-23 00:05 UTC [1][2][3] which caused the auto scaling group to terminate it. I apologize for the inconvenience that this caused. The EC2 team makes every effort they can to warn customers in advance of failing hardware or necessary reboots, however it can't be accomplished in every case unfortunately.    Any software or hardware level issues or loss of network connectivity can cause the underlying hardware to fail resulting in failed system level health checks.

No prior notification was sent to you as the failure was sudden.   When system issues of this nature occur, our dedicated Infrastructure teams thoroughly investigate the cause and architect system improvements. The details of this process are kept highly confidential in order to protect our AWS platform and customers.

I am writing the summary of our conversation below.  You reached out to AWS Premium Support because you observed that there was a status check failure on your instance ""i-047a28e3978506793"" on 23-11-2020 from 19.05 IST to 20:11 IST and you needed to know the cause.   I inspected the instance and observed the following:  i) The underlying hardware that the instance is on was healthy at the same time frame. ii) The instance had experienced spikes in CPU Utilization [1]. iii) As your instance is a burstable instance, the CPU credits [2] were depleted due to the high CPU utilization.  iv) The disk metrics were okay.   Based on the above observations, I confirmed that this is likely caused by an application running on your system which we Premium Support Engineers do not have insight of as per our Shared Responsibility[3] and Data Privacy [4] models.  You asked if downloading excel sheet and images would cause the issue. I responded that honestly speaking, I wouldn't be sure unless you have a monitoring tool that logged the process activities at the time.   I suggested that you can install free resource monitoring tools like Atop [5] which can log process activities.  It was my pleasure working and assisting you on this case and guiding you to the root cause of the issue.  Please feel free to contact me should you have any further questions, concerns or require any additional assistance regarding this Case, I will be happy to assist you again.

You reached out to us requesting assistance with configuring time sync on your instances with Chrony service, this after recommendations from my colleague Dennis. We used the following documentation to configure time and confirmed that it was in sync - https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/set-time.html#configure-amazon-time-service-amazon-linux  ^* 169.254.169.123 3 4 377 3 +2051ns[+3471ns]  We looked at reasons why ssm agent can failed to connect. As promised I have attached a script you can run whenever ssm agent and connectivity fails.  Lastly, with regard to the hardware sensor monitor package failing, I found the following AWS documentation stating that the package has since been deprecated due to availability of similar functionality offered by other packages or lack of meaningful functionality in the context of an AMI running in EC2. - https://aws.amazon.com/amazon-linux-ami/2011.09-release-notes/  I hope I have  addressed your questions; Please feel free to reach out to us again if you have any other questions or concerns.

I understand you plan to create an AMI from instance i-0993f193921c06d61 before you perform an upgrade on the firewall version, and you have some further questions on it.  See answers to your queries below:  1) will it support without any issue  Kindly note that an AMI simply contains a snapshot of each of the EBS volumes attached to an instance. Your EBS volume data will therefore be restored, but it is not aware of number of ENIs attached to it. So if you have hardcoded IP addresses on OS level you may have problems if you need to assign different ENIs with different IP addresses. There is a way though to overcome that as discussed in answer to question 2.   2) after relaunch firewall IP address will be same or change (EC2 has 4 Nic/ ip addresses)  When you restore from an AMI, a single new ENI will be assigned, with a different auto assigned private IP address by default. You have the option though to assign a static IP address to the ENI at launch that is set to the same IP address that eth0 had on instance i-0993f193921c06d61.  Safest way to approach this is to create an AMI from instance i-0993f193921c06d61 before the upgrade, and in case you need to roll back you simply transfer the ENIs the rollback instance launched from the AMI to have the same IP addresses again. Kindly know that the primary ENI cannot be detached, and therefore you simply need to statically assign the same private address again on the primary ENI for the rollback instance.  In case you need to rollback follow steps below:  1) Stop instance i-0993f193921c06d61 2) Launch new rollback instance from the AMI. Set IP address as 10.224.176.100 on the ENI before the launch as described below:  During Launch instance process when you get to ""Step 3: Configure Instance Details"" screen scroll down to see ""Network interfaces"". Under ""Primary IP"" column replace ""Auto-assign"" with IP address 10.224.176.100.  3) Stop the rollback instance too after launch 4) Set same secu",11/25/2020 0:00,11/25/2020 0:00,"RE:[CASE 7657729241] i-0993f193921c06d61,EC2 relaunch using AMI backup.",2,"10.224.176.100,10.224.176.100",hello kalpesh name jacques assisting case understand plan create ami instance perform upgrade firewall version question see answer query support without issue kindly note ami simply contains snapshot eb volume attached instance eb volume data therefore restored aware number enis attached hardcoded address level may problem need assign different enis different address way though overcome discussed answer question relaunch firewall address change ec2 ha nic address restore ami single new assigned different auto assigned private address default option though assign static address launch set address instance safest way approach create ami instance upgrade case need roll back simply transfer enis rollback instance launched ami address kindly know primary detached therefore simply need statically assign private address primary rollback instance case need rollback follow step stop instance launch new rollback instance ami set address launch described launch instance process get step configure instance detail screen scroll see network interface primary column replace auto assign address stop rollback instance launch set secu,9,pleasure premium inconvenience underlying feel contacting hope happy conversation chatting corner incoming reviewed star rated experience ahead rating assisting talking
7959,7662094431,Axis Bank Limited,Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2 - Linux),APAC,INDIA,aabdela,"Hello,   Ahmed here with AWS Premium Support. Thank you for your time over the chat today. Please find the following recap.   You were facing issues updating the ulimits on your instance. Setting the open files limits to unlimited was causing ssh to fail for both root and mysql users. I was able to replicate the same behavior in my lab. After some research we found that the issue was due to limitation of the maximum allowed open files on a system, which is defined in the fs.nr_open sysctl. Setting the nofile limit in the /etc/security/limits.conf to any value higher than the fs.nr_open, including ""unlimted"" will cause the ssh to fail with login denied error.   The issue is mentioned in this official Red Hat article: https://access.redhat.com/solutions/43926  The resolution is to Raise the value of the sysctl setting fs.nr_open (/proc/sys/fs/nr_open) to something greater than or equal to the value being set in ulimit. The article suggested a new high limit of 5000000. This can be set either temporarily using this command:   # echo ""5000000"" > /proc/sys/fs/nr_open  Or persistently using the following:   # echo ""fs.nr_open = 5000000"" >> /etc/sysctl.conf # sysctl -p  One done, you can increase the nofile limit in /etc/security/limits.conf to smaller than or equal to 5000000. I verified the steps in my testing instance as well.   I hope this was helpful. If you have any further inquiries, feel free to revert back to me.   Have a nice day!  We value your feedback.

7961,7662224241,Kantar,Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2 - Windows),APAC,INDIA,sulbri,"Hello,  Thank you for contacting AWS Premium Support, my name is Brian and I will be assisting you today.  Based on the case details, I understand that you are looking for guidance regarding Memory Utilization Monitoring for EC2 Windows Instances. Specifically that you have enabled detailed monitoring for the instance, i-dbefb855, in CloudWatch but were unable to install and configure the agent using AWS Systems Manager.   As you mentioned, the older 3.x versions for EC2Config are not compatible with the SSM Agent and will require EC2Config to be updated to the latest version in order to install and configure the agent through Systems Manager [1].   AWS recommends using the CloudWatch Agent to monitor memory metrics by modifying the CloudWatch Agent configuration file to include the desired metrics that you want to monitor [2].  Since you mentioned that the instance is a production resource, I recommend updating the EC2Config version installed on the instance during a scheduled maintenance period in order to collect metrics in the most accurate way possible.  Alternatively, you could leverage a scheduled task within Windows to execute a PowerShell script to collect the desired metrics and push them to CloudWatch using WMI-based queries to perform calculations using the allocated system memory and utilized memory.    To properly set expectations, AWS Premium Support does not provide code support for custom scripting so you would need to create a script that collects each of the metrics that you would like to monitor [3].   At a high level, for this requirements this solution will require that the IAM role attached to the Instance will need to contain the IAM policy CloudWatchAgentServerPolicy to provide the instance permissions to post the metrics in CloudWatch [4]. The Instance will also require that AWS Tools for PowerShell has been installed in order to leverage the Write-CWMetricData cmdlet to push the data to CloudWatch.

It was nice speaking to you all. ?I hope you are doing great!  You initiated a call as you noticed security updates (KB4565540) were not installed via Windows Update and Microsoft Update. You wanted to know what could be the issue.  During my investigation I found out that the mentioned update (KB4565540) is only available via WSUS and Microsoft Update Catalog. Please see the support document here. [1]  You mentioned that the patch was released during Microsoft Patch Tuesday and wanted to know why this particular security update was not available through windows update.    Due to huge environment size it is not always possible to manually install the patches and because of that you want to know from Microsoft if there is any reason this patch is not available and in future how you can avoid this kind of scenario.  You also shared that WSUS configuration is not an option for you as you have multiple internal AD domains. Regarding this, I was researching further and it may be possible that you can configure a Single WSUS server to push update to your multiple AD domain member servers.  It is not necessary to domain join the WSUS server. Rather the WSUS server can act as a standalone server. You only need to make sure that the network connectivity (open necessary ports and firewall) is there between your different domain members and the WSUS server. For your different domains, you need to use the domain's GPO to point to the WSUS Server and that should work.  Also as you requested I will go ahead and create an internal ticket in services teams queue so that the internal team can further engage Microsoft to resolve your concerns.  For now I am moving the case to Pending Amazon Action. In the meantime if you have any other queries please free to reach out to us and I will be happy to assist again. Have a nice day ahead!

As discussed on the chat, this was due to the underlying hardware failing on the previous host which is why it was failing the both status checks. In order to resolve this, you've taken the correct course of action to stop and start the instance as this moves the instance from the degraded hardware to a healthy underlying hardware.  The reason for this host failing is due to an unrecoverable issue with the underlying hardware which could be due to software or hardware components failing. For this reason, it was recommended to stop and start your instance in order to move it to a healthy host.

You had reached out to us because you wanted to know which ARM based instance types are supported in Seoul region.  We discussed that currently we do not support any ARM (Gravitron) instance types in seoul region. Also, I informed you that currently we do not have any ETA to add arm support in seoul region. However, our internal team do plan to improve our capacity across regions, but there is no certainty as to when it will be in place.

My name is Stephen and I will be assisting you with this case. I understand wordpress application went down on instance i-0a14a17828dbb1ccb and no logs were made during that time.   Looking into instance i-0a14a17828dbb1ccb from 12/5 at 1am IST to 12/6 at 9pm IST I can see the underlying hardware is healthy and did not have any failures. I also checked into the attached EBS volume which is also showing as healthy.   At the time of incident the CPU utilization drops to almost zero as seen here [1], this started on 12/5 at 2:10pm IST and ended on 12/6 at 9am IST. This indicates something on the Operating System was hanging. I would recommend looking into the logs leading up to 12/5 at 2:10pm IST to see if any errors were recorded. When the OS hangs it common for logs to stop being created. I also recommend looking into memory usage around that time if you have memory usage being logged.   Looking into the CPU utilization for the past 24 hours I see spikes that hit 100% utilization and another spike that is 93%, please refer to [2]. I suggest looking into the memory and CPU utilization to verify enough resources are allocated for the application.

My name is Kush and I will be assisting you with this case today.  I have gone through your correspondence and understand that you have been looking into some issues and you suspect the underlying hardware droplet may have some issue thus wanted us to check for any issue related to the underlying host. Please correct me if I misunderstood your query.  Starting with my investigation I have checked all the performance related metrics given below using the CloudWatch graphs for the instance and the underlying hardware, but did not find any issues or abnormality:  1. CPU utilization of the instances is fine. [1] 2. NetworkIn and NetworkOut for the instances have been normal was not hitting any performance bottleneck. 3. Instance status checks for the instances did not fail confirming that the software/network configuration of the instances have been fine. [2] 4.

8098,7718717851,ICICI LOMBARD GENERAL INSURANCE COMPANY LIMITED,Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2 - Windows),APAC,INDIA,toryswyk,"Hello Roopali,  Thank you for reaching out to AWS Premium Support, it was a pleasure working with you today. Below is a summary of our conversation:  An instance which was working previously was no longer accepting RDP connections. I examined the instance and found the security groups and network ACLs were configured to allow inbound traffic on TCP 3389 from the IP address (172.30.34.135) you were connecting from. Pulling an instance screenshot, I found a networking issue is present within the OS, indicated by a warning icon displayed over the networking icon on the windows lock screen.  As the instance had already been stopped and started, we decided to move forward with using EC2Rescue to work on the instance [1].   Unfortunately, something happened causing you to disconnect from the chat.  The next step is to stop the instance, detach the root volume (vol-0ba29a16919b86600) and then attach it to a recovery instance within the same availability zone (ap-sough-1b) [2][3].  Once connected to the helper instance, download and run EC2Rescue. I suggest going through the diagnose and rescue options first to detect any possible issues. If there are no detected issues, you may wish to apply windows recovery tools. I suggest starting with System File Checker by running the command below from an administrative cmd window:  sfc /scannow  Sfc will take time to examine the Windows file system and attempt to replace any corrupted or damaged system files [4]. If any issues are detected, sfc will display them in the cmd window after it finishes running.  Dism is the next tool to use [5]. If you choose to run it, please run the following DISM commands from an administrative cmd window:  Dism /online /cleanup-image /scanhealth  Dism /online /cleanup-image /checkhealth  Dism /online /cleanup-image /restorehealth  It will take time for the Dism commands to finish running. Dism will help by either correcting the issue, or providing output indicating what the next troubleshooting steps are.

8103,7720558741,ANI Technologies Pvt Ltd  (AISPL),Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2 - Linux),APAC,INDIA,mckeenjm,"Hello! Jason with AWS here and I have your case.  There was a health check failure for one of your instances and looking for more information as to what/why.  When it comes to the health checks on an instance, the system health check[1] is a mark of the underlying host that your instance is running on. In most cases if you see this health check failing, it is a safe guess that something is happening to the underlying hardware that your instance is on. I took some time to verify this, and can confirm that at Thu Dec 10 2020 22:26:00 UTC the host began to show issues, and our automated system started to work on recovering the host. As of this time, the host is still showing issues and has scene been removed from our fleet. The action you took in response to the health check failures, stopping and starting the instance[2], has moved it to a new host which looks to be operating as expected as of this time. Should you with to automate this recovery process, you can set up actions to be executed on alarm triggering[3] that include performing a stop/start action on the instance.  On behalf of AWS please allow me to apologies for any inconvenience this may have caused you, if you have any followup questions please let me know and I'll see what I can do.  1) https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/monitoring-system-instance-status-check.html#system-status-checks 2) https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/Stop_Start.html#instance_stop 3) https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-instance-recover.html  We value your feedback.

The VPN in question was  vpn-096e81b3dac92d46d.  1. I went through your configuration and checked security group, Network ACL and route table and I did not find any issue with the configuration itself.  2. I also checked the underlying system and did not find the issue there as well.  3. I checked the tunnel state for 13.232.209.89 and and looked like the tunnel was UP during the time frame you had mentioned.  But had gone down  around 06:55 UTC time. I am assuming the issue started happening around the same time.  Checking the logs, I could see that the tunnel had gone down because of DPD which means that the CGW did not respond to the DPD message sent from AWS side.

From the case notes I understand that your instance i-0620841e8d928445d was failing both the status checks and  became unreachable. After you did stop/start instance came back online again. However you would like to know the reason for the status checks failure and suggestion to overcome such issue in future.  Using our internal tools, I quickly reviewed your instance i-0620841e8d928445d and found that the instance was running on a degraded hardware due to which instance failed both the status checks at around 2020-12-14 23:14 UTC. Please refer cloudwatch metrics [1] and [2] to review status checks at your end. After you performed stop/start at around 2020-12-15 00:01 UTC, your instance was successfully moved to another underlying host. Currently I can see your instance is running on a healthy host and hence passing both the status checks.  Furthermore I would like to inform you that we have automated systems in place which constantly monitors the health of the underlying hosts and whenever it identifies a potential issue with the host, we pro-actively send out retirement notifications to our customers, in order to prevent downtime. Hence, in your case as well, I could see this degradation on the underlying hardware, hosting your instance, was already detected by our automated systems and therefore hardware was scheduled for retirement.

You can check the details about this retirement event in your Personal Health Dashboard (PHD) with an Event name - ""EC2 persistent instance retirement scheduled"".

To summarize you had initiated a call with us today as you were experiencing an issue where your jenkins server configured to write on a EFS suddenly starts writing to your EBS volume /home/jenkins which resulted in the disk becoming full and causing instance issues.  Via the call we looked at /var/log/messages to see if we could see any timeouts regarding the EFS and could see no such messages. In addition I had you pull up your /etc/fstab entries for which you were using the recommended settings (to rule out any issues with those options which could cause timeouts)  We unfortunately did not have an exact time frame for when this issue occurred so my search was done from the 12 hour period before you noticed the disk issue which was roughly around 12:00 UTC.   EC2 Side: Taking a look at the instance side metrics, I looked for any outages during the time frame which this had occurred and found no issues.   I also looked at the network interface itself and looked for any instances of packets being dropped during this time frame and found no issues.    On the EFS side:  I checked for any instances of decreasing client connections (any abnormality from the 1 client connection) / Any issues with the EFS hitting its max throughput / Any credit balance issues and found no issues on any of those fronts.   From an AWS perspective I did not see anything which would indicate that the instance lost connection or was impacted which would have resulted in the jenkins workspace data being written to the /home/jenkins directory.

8164,7757083651,Amagi Media Labs Private Limited,Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2 - Linux),APAC,INDIA,moegalli,"Hello, Allie here from the AWS Cape Town team.  I have worked through all of the logs and metrics available to me, but could not find a reason for why the CPU utilization of instance i-048f4049fcc232def spiked and the instance started failing its instance health checks.  I can see where the instance level health checks [1] started failing at 2020/12/18 00:51 UTC [2]. But I did not find any issues with the underlying hardware serving the instance before the stop/start. Besides the 100% CPU utilization [3], I also checked the other instance metrics available to me (Network and Storage), and also did know find any utilization that would have caused an issue. I also worked through the instance system log [4], but once again did not see any reason for the unresponsiveness.  As AWS support engineers do not have access to the inner workings of customer resources, I would like to ask that you check the operating system logs for any sign of what could have happened. I regularly use these commands while troubleshooting such issues:    dmesg | grep -e ""error\|fail\|fatal\|panic\|trace""   sudo grep -e ""error\|fail\|fatal\|panic\|trace"" /var/log/messages  Additionally, because high CPU utilization looks to be related to the issue, a tool like atop[5] that logs what process is utilizing resources can help find what was causing the issue. Finally, if you find another instance that is unresponsive, consider checking the screenshot [6] from it before stop/starting. I find this very often has useful information.  I trust that this information is helps, but please let me know if there is any more assistance that I can offer.

Thank you for your time over the call. It was a pleasure chatting with you. I am sharing a brief summary of our discussion on the chat.  You reached out to us because you were having issues while trying to launch instance from the AMI ""ami-0fff9ae8a94438678"".   While we were on the chat we checked the cloudtrail history for any RunInstances API call and found that these api calls were failing with the error ""You are not authorized to perform this operation"" along with an encoded authorization message. We tried to decode this error message using sts decode-authorization-message api call [1] but received the SSL verification error [2].  Moving further we discussed that the AMI had encrypted volumes and verified from the cloudtrail api call ""8b0475f2-c833-405a-a796-a393e4ef237d"" for RunInstances API call. We discussed that this can be caused if the IAM role used to launch the instance does not have appropriate IAM permissions. I checked the IAM permissions for the role ""AWS-Admin"" and found that it had admin access to perform all the actions required to launch the instance.  We discussed that the account was a part of organization ""zawsw2evud"" and checked the Organization Control policy for the account. We checked and found a policy with SID ""DenyRunInstanceWithNoTags"", which was restricting the RunInstances API Call if certain tags are not present on the volumes as well as the instance. I cross checked the tags attached to the instance and the ones which are required to launch the instance and found that one tag ""OAS Number"" was missing from the instance. After creating this tag, the instance launch was successful as verified on the meetings session.   Moving further we discussed if there is any way you can ensure that certain tags are always present on the EC2 instance while it is being launnched to prevent adding tags manually. I find a way to achieve this for EC2 instances using the Launch Template.

My name is Manu and I will be assisting you with this case.   I understand that you are looking for some help to resize secondary volume of couple of your ec2 instances.

You can complete the operation by extending the filesystem using the ""resize2fs"" command to make free space available within the filesystem. Detailed instructions is as follows,  Note: Before proceeding with the resize operation, I strongly recommend you to take a snapshot of the volume. These command rewrite filesystem metadata and in case anything went wrong it results in complete dataloss, so a back up will help you to recover data from such unlikely events.   1 - As per the lsblk output there not much free space available,2TB of space is currently being in use by the lvm volume mongodb-mongo--data. So first of all you would want to resize volume xvdb from aws console to add more free space.   2 - Using below commands, verify current lvm configuration,     root#pvdisplay    root#vgdisplay    root#lvdisplay    root# df -h    root# fdisk -l  3) After resizing the EBS volume, the newly added space needed to be added to the physical volume, use below commands for that,     root#pvresize /dev/xvdb    root#pvscan     root#vgdisplay   Now the vgdisplay command should show free space available in the in the VG.

As discussed I am sending you a summary email.  We got on call and screenshare and checked the event viewer logs for instance i-062724e820ad98f56, under system logs we could see errors and warning starting around 12 noon on 18th December. In the errors we can see that DNSClient service was crashing, Kerberos(KDC) service was unable to recognize the computer objects and the machine was running low on memory with following errors ""Windows successfully diagnosed a low virtual memory condition."" ""The server was unable to allocate from the system nonpaged pool because the pool was empty""  From the Cloudwatch logs on our end we can see that instance failed instance health check around 3:30 PM but from the OS logs we can see the instance was facing the issue much before that. As stated in my previous email the instance's outgoing packet count had already dropped after 2PM IST but still the OS was up and running on low memory. Instance status checks monitor the software and network configuration of your individual instance. Amazon EC2 checks the health of the instance by sending an address resolution protocol (ARP) request to the network interface (NIC). https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/monitoring-system-instance-status-check.html#instance-status-checks  So it seems till 3:30 PM the OS was responding to AWS hardware but after that it possibly crashed due to low memory or due to low memory it was unable to respond to AWS's address resolution protocol (ARP) requests.  Please note, by default Cloudwatch does not monitor the memory consumption, we have to enable that manually and as discussed on call you mentioned that you have enabled memory monitoring now.  Also when it comes to domain controllers it is suggested to run on minimum 16GB memory by Microsoft and as we know it was running earlier on T3.medium which had 4GB memory.

A quick recap; You have reached out to us because you wanted to configure memory metrics in Cloudwatch agent.  I would like to inform that by default AWS does not push memory metrics to Cloudwatch. However, you can use CloudWatch Agent on EC2 instance to push this data to CloudWatch.  You can store and view the metrics that you collect with the CloudWatch agent in CloudWatch just as you can with any other CloudWatch metrics.   You configured CloudWatch Agent and customized the script to push the memory data. You had confusion with committed bytes because generally it represent the pagefile. Please note that CloudWatch have different metrics for pagefile named pagefile. After configuration, we looked at the metrics and we found it correct.

8272,7812093991,TATA SIA Airlines Ltd,Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2 - Linux),APAC,INDIA,mcmciara,"Greetings Sivaranchani,  This is Ciara from the chat with AWS Support. I'm following up with a summary of our chat today.  You opened the case as you were facing issues with connecting to i-0c0ec3f016656e117 over XRDP.    I did not find any problem at the AWS infrastructure level, the instance & the host it sits on are both healthy and passing health checks. Looking over the underlying network and hardware, there was no problems that would be causing issues.    When checking the resource usage I observed CPU usage hitting 100%, which you confirmed related to the time you ran the groupinstall command.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------   https://ap-southeast-1.console.aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/deeplink.js?region=ap-southeast-1#metricsV2:graph=%7B%22metrics%22%3A%5B%5B%22AWS%2FEC2%22%2C%22CPUUtilization%22%2C%22InstanceId%22%2C%22i-0c0ec3f016656e117%22%5D%5D%2C%22stat%22%3A%22Maximum%22%2C%22period%22%3A300%2C%22start%22%3A%222020-12-31T12%3A58%3A11%2B00%3A00%22%2C%22end%22%3A%222021-01-01T12%3A58%3A11%2B00%3A00%22%2C%22region%22%3A%22ap-southeast-1%22%7D  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  As the issue you are facing relates to an application misconfiguration it falls outside the scope of AWS support [1]. Moreover any assistance provided is on a best effort basis.   I advised you to review  application and system logs for further insight into what is causing the disconnection. You should also review the configuration of XRDP to ensure it is configured correctly.   Checking online I came across the following 3rd party guide for configuring XDRP for RHEL 8 and advised you to review this for steps that you may have missed during installation:  https://www.itzgeek.com/how-tos/linux/centos-how-tos/how-to-install-xrdp-on-red-hat-enterprise-linux-8.html  As agreed on the chat I will go ahead ",1/1/2021 0:00,1/1/2021 0:00,RE:[CASE 7812093991] Chat: Session disconnected after login - XRDP,3,"https://ap-southeast-1.console.aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/deeplink.js?region=ap-southeast-1#metricsV2:graph=%7B%22metrics%22%3A%5B%5B%22AWS%2FEC2%22%2C%22CPUUtilization%22%2C%22InstanceId%22%2C%22i-0c0ec3f016656e117%22%5D%5D%2C%22stat%22%3A%22Maximum%22%2C%22period%22%3A300%2C%22start%22%3A%222020-12-31T12%3A58%3A11%2B00%3A00%22%2C%22end%22%3A%222021-01-01T12%3A58%3A11%2B00%3A00%22%2C%22region%22%3A%22ap-southeast-1%22%7D,https://www.itzgeek.com/how-tos/linux/centos-how-tos/how-to-install-xrdp-on-red-hat-enterprise-linux-8.html",greeting sivaranchani ciara chat aws support following summary chat today opened case facing issue connecting xrdp find problem aws infrastructure level instance host sits healthy passing health check looking underlying network hardware wa problem would causing issue checking resource usage observed usage hitting confirmed related time ran groupinstall command issue facing relates application misconfiguration fall outside scope aws support moreover assistance provided best effort basis advised review application system log insight causing disconnection also review configuration xrdp ensure configured correctly checking online came across following party guide configuring xdrp rhel advised review step may missed installation agreed chat ahead,9,pleasure premium inconvenience underlying feel contacting hope happy conversation chatting corner incoming reviewed star rated experience ahead rating assisting talking
8273,7813929981,TriCore Solutions Private Limited,Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2 - Linux),APAC,INDIA,jobinjob,"Hi Aman,   Thank you for writing back to us.   As I have mentioned in the previous email, We are unable to find any issue from the infrastructure point that might caused the status check failures on the instance by analyzing the metrics. We have only noticed a couple of things that suggest that the ebs volume activity seems to be relatively high before the status check failure occurred on the instance and also console log suggest that there was a kernel panic event that was triggered.   Since we AWS engineers does not have access to the instance or visibility to the configuration or logs on the instance, we are unable to gather any more information from our side. In order to identify more details and what would have caused the kernel panic and its timeframe etc, you need to analyze system logs and application logs. As mentioned on our public documentation, ""These checks detect problems that require your involvement to repair. When an instance status check fails, you typically must address the problem yourself (for example, by rebooting the instance or by making instance configuration changes).   The following are examples of problems that can cause instance status checks to fail:      Failed system status checks     Incorrect networking or startup configuration     Exhausted memory     Corrupted file system     Incompatible kernel"" [1].   With that said, you need to analyze the system logs on the instance (eg: /var/log/messages, /var/log/dmesg  boot.log etc) to get more information on kernel panic mentioned earlier. Also check other metric like the memory utilizations on the instance or any OOM events. Without having a proper analyze on the same and identify the exact root cause, we would not able to provide any solution as well.   Also as mentioned earlier, please keep in mind that you are running the application on RHEL 6 OS and this OS is already EOS [2] and it is worth to check your system patches are upto date (Please have a valid backup before performing any patching).

During the call, you highlighted that the instance subnet association was changed to another route table as you intended to associate multiple route table to it. However, it dissociated from the main route table [rtb-0e9181c24e64f4cbe].   As I mentioned on the chime session, a subnet can only be associated with one route table at a time and a Network Interface can be associated to a subnet. For more information, see the documentation [1]  I recommended updating the route table with desired routes. However, if the need to have different routes on an instance is needed, you can create a new Elastic Network interface in a new subnet (The subnet should be associated to the desired route table) then associate it to the instance.  It was a pleasure working with you today. I will go ahead to close this case on your behalf as discussed. Should you have any further queries or concerns, feel free to reach out to me.

8402,7885249721,Amagi Media Labs Private Limited,Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2 - Linux),APAC,INDIA,rmmelhad,"Hello Ravi,  Thanks for your time on the chat, it was nice talking to you. I'm sending this email as a recap on our conversation for your reference.  You reached out as the 8 instances from different AZs that stream to your instance i-07d8e9f0992ac121f had a hit for around 1 second at exactly same time at 2021-01-19 06:31:25 UTC.  I checked the instance i-07d8e9f0992ac121f and confirmed that there were no network limits being hit or dropped packets for your ENI eni-0f775daa903d3413e, as well as no dropped packets or networking issues affecting the underlying host or inter-AZ traffic. I also found no spikes in CPU utilization (which was around 30% the whole time), no EBS volume latency spikes on either volumes, and also that both vol-0865df804d0371863 and vol-0a49886c1519f76ae had their average queue length below 1. From an AWS infrastructure perspective, everything looks fine.  I asked if your instance had atop or sar collecting historical metrics and you mentioned that they're set up with a collection interval of 10 minutes, which therefore would not provide insights into its metrics during that second when the issue happened.  You confirmed that there were no events on the instance OS and application logs during the time frame of the incident. As there were no dropped packets and considering that no other service/application running in the same instance was affected by those events, this further suggests something internal to the instance (OS or application related) rather than a networking issue.  I recommended to consider configuring atop[1] with a collection interval of 1 second in order to have visibility into the exact second of the issue should it happen again. As this would consume more disk space, saving the atop log files on a separate EBS volume can be useful to avoid filling up your root filesystem with them.  === References:  [1] atop for Linux server performance analysis - https://haydenjames.io/use-atop-linux-server-performance-analysis/ ===  As requested, I am closing this case.

8404,7885261421,HDFC Life Insurance Company Limited,Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2 - Windows),APAC,INDIA,boltthom,"Hello,  Once again, this is Thomas from AWS Premium support, and the call discussing this case with you today was my pleasure.  To recap, after the Instance has been on line for a while, SSM Connect and RDP stop working to the Instance.  On the call, we verified the issue, and then stop/started the Instance to get access. Once on the Instance, we ran EC2Rescue in online mode in order to get the logs for the system [1]. The EC2Rescue log bundle was then uploaded to the AWS S3 Support Uploader and I reviewed the System event log.  The below errors and warnings in the event log indicate that virtual memory (the page file) is running out of space. As mentioned on the call, the general recommendation for page file management is to let Windows manage the size of the page file.  Source: Service Control Manager   EventID: 7023  Log Name: System Level: Error     The Windows Error Reporting Service service terminated with the following error:      The paging file is too small for this operation to complete.  Source: Resource-Exhaustion-Detect EventID: 2004 Log Name: System Level: Warning     Windows successfully diagnosed a low virtual memory condition. The following programs consumed the most virtual memory: python.exe (4476) consumed 4429750272 bytes, python.exe (4076) consumed 993099776 bytes, and MsMpEng.exe (1844) consumed 174206976 bytes   These errors explain why RDP and SSM are not running successful, and it was agreed to try increasing the size of the Instance in order to get more memory.  Please note page file configuration and memory management in Python are outside the current scope of support. That being said, I will be happy to provide any help that I can on a best effort basis.  I hope the information provided today has been helpful and my services have met or exceeded your expectations. Please let me know if you have any questions or concerns for the above requests, and please feel free to reach out again for any other assistance we may offer.

As promised, I am sending you a summary of our chat as follows:-  You mentioned that you are trying to install AWS PV drivers on instance ""i-0639f7db704212259"", but you were getting error ""Operating system is not supported"".  Upon screenshare, we found that you were trying to install the AWS PV drivers on Windows server 2008 OS, which is not supported and is expected. Cause the AWS PV drivers are supported from 2008R2 OS and above and windows server 2008 support AWS Citrix PV drivers, for more information please check the link [1].  With that being said, we tried to upgrade the Citrix PV drivers from the AWS link [2], however the instance went to 1/2 check failed and had lost the network.  We did try to attach additional ENI, however it was not picking up the network. So we have created a root volume from the backup AMI and replaced it with the affected instance root volume ""vol-02edd0fedc9fc9a1f"" and after that we restarted the instance from console and it passed 2/2 checks again.  From the console logs we can see that the instance is already using up to date Citrix PV drivers and doesn't need any further update, however Citrix PV is a discontinued product and is an obsolete driver.  In order to install AWS PV drivers on the instance, you may have to upgrade the OS version from 2008 to 2008R2 and then only you will be able to install the AWS PVE drivers.  As discussed, I will be marking this case as resolved.  In case you have any questions or concerns, please feel free to get in touch with me and I will be happy to assist you again.

Just wanted to post a brief summary of our chat.  You had reached out to us because you were unable to use GP3 volumes in your Launch configurations.  We recommend that you create Auto Scaling groups from launch templates to ensure that you're accessing the latest features and improvements, such as GP3 compatibility, Versioning, T2 Unlimited, EBS volume tagging and others.  I also informed you that there is an ongoing feature request for GP3 volumes release with Launch Configuration, but there is no ETA for that at the moment. So, if you would like to use GP3, the fastest approach will be to consider migration to Launch Templates instead.  I hope the above information is helpful. As we discussed, I am marking this case as resolved. However, please feel free to reach back to us if you have any questions or concerns. We are always glad to help you.

I understand that you have observed one of the Java processes experienced failure upon reaching EC2 metadata service. You are seeking AWS support to investigate the issue.  Thanks for providing the log snippet and EC2 instance ID 'i-08df64e87b95e6dbd'.  First I have checked the performance of the instance using CloudWatch metrics and moved my investigation to look into the backend logs. I have checked CPU, Network and Disk performance and it is within the acceptable limit for a 'm5zn.xlarge' type EC2 instance. The status checks for instance as well as system is also not logged with any issues. This confirms there is no issues exist from the AWS and the Operating System is also healthy.  I have looked into the instance System Logs and there was no errors logged by the Operating System console.  Further, I used my internal tools and checked whether any known issues existed in the region and AZ (eu-central-1b). I did not find any.  To understand more and continue the investigation, I request to you provide the following details.   a) Could you try contacting the metadata server by using ""curl"" utility and share the results.   $ curl -Iv http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/instance-id   $ curl http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/instance-id   b) Collect the OS logs   $ test -f /etc/yum.repos.d/epel.repo || sudo yum install -y https://dl.fedoraproject.org/pub/epel/epel-release-latest-6.noarch.rpm   $ sudo yum -y install sos --enablerepo=epel   $ sudo sosreport --batch --tmp-dir /var/log/   $ tar cvzf /tmp/log_7887835761.tar.gz /var/log    Attach /var/log/sosreport-*.tar.xz to this case using either of below steps.    i) Please use the below simple method to push log bundle directly from your instance    $ cd /tmp    $ file=""log_7887835761.tar.gz""     $ curl -s curl -s https://d1mg6achc83nsz.cloudfront.net/62a89ec5692e89c2b54fa8e9b41baeed5b0ac31ef328a584141045f40d1f2c8b/eu-central-1/$file",1/20/2021 0:00,1/20/2021 0:00,"RE:[CASE 7887835761] after 30m, ec2net fails to get metadata, locks up all network connectivity",2,"http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/instance-id,http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/instance-id,https://dl.fedoraproject.org/pub/epel/epel-release-latest-6.noarch.rpm,https://d1mg6achc83nsz.cloudfront.net/62a89ec5692e89c2b54fa8e9b41baeed5b0ac31ef328a584141045f40d1f2c8b/eu-central-1/$file",hello thank contacting aws premium support name ruchikka helping case today understand observed one java process experienced failure upon reaching ec2 metadata service seeking aws support investigate issue thanks providing log snippet ec2 instance first checked performance instance using cloudwatch metric moved investigation look backend log checked network disk performance within acceptable limit type ec2 instance status check instance well system also logged issue confirms issue exist aws operating system also healthy looked instance system log wa error logged operating system console used internal tool checked whether known issue existed region find understand continue investigation request provide following detail could try contacting metadata server using curl utility share result curl curl collect log test sudo yum install sudo yum install sudo sosreport batch tmp dir tar cvzf attach case using either step please use simple method push log bundle directly instance tmp file curl curl,9,pleasure premium inconvenience underlying feel contacting hope happy conversation chatting corner incoming reviewed star rated experience ahead rating assisting talking

You reached out to us for assistance in shutting down (terminating) some of your EC2 instances that are no longer in use (Instance IDs: i-0091448db02b1e5d1 - IP address: 10.10.3.126, i-090f2bf0464aaca95 - IP address: 10.10.3.103, i-0f1c7d560724ea97e - IP address: 10.10.3.104) and for assistance in implementing a solution to have the remaining 2 EC2 instances running on a specific schedule.    For future reference, you can follow the detailed steps in this documentation to terminate an EC2 instance [1].  For instructions on how to disable instance termination protection, in case it is enabled and preventing you to terminate the instance, please read this documentation [2].  It is always recommended to create a backup of your instance before terminating it, to ensure that you can always retrieve your data should you need it. Please refer to this documentation for detailed steps on how to create a backup (AMI) of your EC2 instance [3].  To start and stop your instances on a schedule, you can either leverage AWS Instance Scheduler [4] or use a simpler solution that leverages Lambda and CloudWatch Events [5].  In order to determine which instance size best suit your application, it is recommended to benchmark the application (CPU, memory, disk performance needs); that would give you an idea of the requirements of the instance size needed to handle the application workload. The following documentations provide more information on this [6][7].  It was a pleasure to chat with you. I wish you a great day further. If you need further assistance or if there be anything else that I can help you with, please do not hesitate to reach out to me and I'll gladly assist further.

It was my pleasure working with you. I am writing the summary of our conversation below.  You have reached to support since you would like to delete the snapshot that are created manually or as a part of AMI Creation before x number of days.   As I have mentioned over the chat, you need to delete the same manually via the CLI or AWS console. You may also develop a custom script for the same as well. While I was looking for the some of the sample for your reference the chat was disconnected. However, I have included some of the useful commands to achieve your use case below.   You can use the below mentioned script that make use of aws cli to list the snapshots that are created before some particular days for eg:29-02-2020.   PLEASE NOTE : The delete operation is performed for any snapshot on the account, that are created manually, via AMI or via DLM. Hence, please keep in mind that the command will not sort these volumes based on how it was created and it will delete the snapshots as long as the number of days criteria is met. Please test this on a lower environment before applying it on the production account as this has some delete commands which is not recoverable.   Sample CLI command for a specific date and older: ================================================= Here is the sample script to describe and delete snapshots older than 2020-02-29 which can be tailored based on your needs.      # for i in $(aws ec2 describe-snapshots --owner-ids <your account ID> --Region <AWS region> --query 'Snapshots[?StartTime<=`2020-02-29`].SnapshotId' --output text); do  echo ""aws ec2 delete-snapshot --snapshot-id $i; sleep 5; done""; done  Above will generate the delete snapshot commands once you verify and made sure they are the ones you expect to be deleted you could simply run the same without echo like below.  To delete snapshots before that day:   for i in $(aws ec2 describe-snapshots --owner-ids <your account ID> --region <AWS Region> --query 'Snapshot",1/29/2021 0:00,1/29/2021 0:00,RE:[CASE 7927529391] Chat: Need help to configure EBS lifecycle manager,4,,siddharth greeting thank time chat wa pleasure working writing summary conversation reached support since would like delete snapshot created manually part ami creation number day mentioned chat need delete manually via cli aws console may also develop custom script well wa looking sample reference chat wa disconnected however included useful command achieve use case use mentioned script make use aws cli list snapshot created particular day please note delete operation performed snapshot account created manually via ami via hence please keep mind command sort volume based wa created delete snapshot long number day criterion met please test lower environment applying production account ha delete command recoverable sample cli command specific date older sample script describe delete snapshot older tailored based need aws ec2 describe snapshot owner id account region aws region query snapshot starttime snapshotid output text echo aws ec2 delete snapshot snapshot id sleep done done generate delete snapshot command verify made sure one expect deleted could simply run without echo like delete snapshot day aws ec2 describe snapshot owner id account region aws region query snapshot,9,pleasure premium inconvenience underlying feel contacting hope happy conversation chatting corner incoming reviewed star rated experience ahead rating assisting talking
8519,7927970371,ICICI LOMBARD GENERAL INSURANCE COMPANY LIMITED,Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2 - Linux),APAC,INDIA,satsinha,"Greetings, Thank you for reaching out to us.  I have summarized the conversation that we had as follows:     -  The instance was not booting as it was showing the error for ""Emergency Mode"".     -  We performed a detach and attach of the volume and found that the device name was used against ""/App_home"" directory.     -  We commented the entry and booted the instance. It worked.     -  We found that there was one device which was not attached.     -  Although, it was considered as a valid approach to check with your application team on the fstab configuration.     -  We discussed the following points regarding fstab entries configuration:             1.  Use of UUID than the device name         The use of UUID is recommended for identifying devices/filesystems to be mounted.         Use of nvme device name is especially is not recommended as these are not persistent name.              2.  nofail option in fstab entries         For testing for secondary volumes, the nofail parameter is recommended.         This parameter is to ensure that in case the device is not found or incorrect device was attempted to mount, the boot would not fail to emergency mode and would continue.                      3.  Test the fstab entry using mount -av.         Use the mount -av to check if the mount mentioned in the fstab works successfully or not.         This is a recommended step to diagnose fstab issues.  As discussed, I have marked  the case as closed. If you have other issues or concerns, please do reach out to us. Have a good one !  We value your feedback.

8715,7985230371,Wynk Limited,Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2 - Linux),APAC,INDIA,deanmc,"Dear Sourabh,  This is Dean from the AWS Premium Support Linux Team, it was a pleasure speaking to you over chat earlier.  Our chat was prematurely terminated before I could provide you with more information. However I can confirm that I have the information that you requested.  During our chat I spent time researching a possible reason as to why the Gravitron instance types were unavailable, and I believed it be the fact that they were not populating due to the AMI in the launch configuration/template for your spot requests.   Afterward you had questions regarding the spot-interruption rates for ap-south-1 (Mumbai) I tried to determine this from my side however there was/is no data for these instance types, the Spot Instance interruption rate data is based on the Frequency of interruption represents the rate at which Spot has reclaimed capacity during the trailing month. They are in ranges of < 5%, 5-10%,10-15%,15-20% and >20%.   In this case, if instances are not in the table it means there is no data on spot instance interruptions for a given region, I checked for other regions (af-south-1, Cape Town and eu-south-1, Milan) and I see that some Gravitron instance family types do not reflect here either along with other instance types, so here we see its not specific to the instance type but rather the data required to generate interruption rates, the values of these rates depend on the usage/launches of spot instances over time i a particular region.   I do however thank you for allowing me to look into this for you, and allowing you to answer your question.   If you have any additional followup questions on this matter then please feel free to revert back to me.

You reached out as you were having issues with your instance ""i-07aa006dbca33ce40"" which Starts but suddenly goes to Stop state with an error ""Client.InstanceInitiatedShutdown""  Upon doing a thorough research and investigation on this issue, I was able to narrow this issue to an action being triggered from the OS of the instance. In particular, the ""Client.InstanceInitiatedShutdown"" occurs when there is a $shutdown -h commands that is triggered from the OS of this instance.  Please note, as AWS engineers we do not have access to the OS level of your instances due to strict security constraints, so I am therefore unable to see what or who exactly runs this $shutdown -h inside the instance. However, as a way to mitigate and find the root cause of this issue, we need to have  access to the OS level of this instance to be able to see what triggers the $shutdown -h command. To do this, you would have to    1. Detach the root volume of the instance ""i-07aa006dbca33ce40"" and attach it to another instance test instance as secondary volume.   2. Mount the volume to be able to have access to its OS shell.   3. Execute the following to check what triggers the shutdowm i.e     3.1.  Please check which Target is the default target in your instance. It could be that the default target on th instance is set to 0     $ systemctl get-default     $ systemctl set-default graphical.target    3.2 You can execute the following commands to display the list of last reboots/shutdowns.

You reached out to us because when you run command ""/apollo/env/MusicPersonalizationPlatformAdmiralWorkflows/python3.6/bin/real/python3.6 "", you ran into errors with:   /lib64/libc.so.6: version `GLIBC_2.25' not found (required by /apollo/env/MusicPersonalizationPlatformAdmiralWorkflows/python3.6/lib/libpython3.6m.so.1.0)  This error indicates the issues is python 3.6 in your machine compiled/linked against GLIBC-2.25 (or later). To check the version of GLIBC, you can run the following command:  $ ldd --version . Since you will have to drop the chat, and I am not 100% sure about your environment ( Your AMI is private ), it's hard for me to suggest the next steps, because upgrading GLIBC can break a lot of programs running within your instance that relies on the current GLIBC. Moving forward, please feel free to initiate another chat/call with us, and the available engineer will be able to help you with troubleshooting further.   I hope you found these information useful.

8798,8021525341,Jubilant FoodWorks Limited,Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2 - Windows),APAC,INDIA,mogammp,"Good day,  Parker here and a pleasure to be working this case.  The instance appears healthy and reachable. I will need further information give the exact problem however, I noticed the instance was managed by Systems Manager. There is an option of using an automation document for automated troubleshooting with the details in the link below: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/WindowsGuide/troubleshoot-connect-windows-instance.html#Troubleshooting-Remote-Desktop-Connection-issues-using-AWS-Systems-Manager  The document will fix common issues such as administrator password reset and OS-level firewalls. Alternatively, refer to the manual steps here: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/WindowsGuide/troubleshoot-connect-windows-instance.html#rdp-issues   These are the details from my end:  - There are no status check failures and the instance screenshot shows a boot screen. - There is an RDP certificate in the system log[2] indicating RDP is set and the default Administrator is in-use. - The instance is in a private subnet and it must be accessed by a bastion host. - The security group has 180.190.3.170/32, 180.190.3.171/32 and AD CIDRs on sg-0a1fa5f4f6a78ce49 for RDP access. However, there is a 446 - 65535 (0.0.0.0/0) rule allowing all IP addresses. If this were to be an issue I would suggest running the following command from the bastion hosts:  Test-NetConnection 10.160.55.21 -port 3389  The SourceAddress field indicates the bastion outgoing address. Additionally, this command tells if you are able to make a connection to the host. - There is a NACL blocking access to the 172.31.0.0/20 CIDR block.  In summary, the instance appears reachable and more information is needed for an answer. Namely: 1. The RDP screenshot error. At a glance, a screenshot indicates if it is a networking, OS-level or password issue. 2. Does Test-NetConnection return true for bastion hosts? If so, may I have the full output? 3.

8818,8024212371,DXC Technology Company,Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2 - Windows),APAC,INDIA,snsidd,"Hello,  Greetings for the day!  Thank you for reaching back. I understand that you have some further queries related to EC2 and subnets.  Regarding your query about instance only having a Public IP and not a private IP, I want to explain that and EC2 instances require private IP to interact with resources in within the VPC and AWS infrastructure. We cannot also remove the private IP as it will be like removing the Network Interface of the instance in which the instance will stop communicating with the AWS environment and will result into 1/2 checks failing. The public IP however, is required to interact with the internet such that the internet is publically accessible from the internet.  Regarding your query ""is there a way to convert/move the current IP from Private VPC to Public IP Subnet?"" The Private IP cannot be moved to another subnet/VPC because the Private IP is assigned within a CIDR range and each subnet has a different CIDR range. Thus, we will not be able to assign same Private IP in a different subnet.  Now, coming to your query on how to assign a Public IP to the instance or move the instance to a public subnet. You can achieve this via either of the two methods given below:  A. Convert the existing Private Subnet into a Public Subnet: ==========================================  1. Create an Internet gateway for your current VPC (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/VPC_Internet_Gateway.html#Add_IGW_Attach_Gateway).  2. Add a route in the route table/ Replace the route for destination ""0.0.0.0/0"" and add your Internet Gateway instead of NAT gateway ""nat-0b9b37f465aac79e0"".(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/VPC_Internet_Gateway.html#Add_IGW_Routing)  3. Now create/Allocate an Elastic IP.(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/elastic-ip-addresses-eip.html#using-instance-addressing-eips-allocating)  4.

My name is Priyanka and I will be assisting you with the case today.  I understand that you would like to know the instance status check failure details which occurred at 12:45:00 - 01:15:00 UTC 2021-02-21. Feel free to correct me if I am wrong.  I have reviewed the instance i-06468fc5b908d8815 performance metrics and could see that there was no issue reported with the underlying host[1] during the same time. On further investigation on this, I didn't find evidences of an underlying host issue/failure and therefore you may need to review the OS level logs to understand why this has occurred at instance/OS level.  Further, I checked the other performance metrics of the instance like the CPU Utilization [2] and EBS volume performance, and I could see both are operating normally. Unfortunately, we do not have access to the memory usage of your instance, hence I will not be able to comment on that part. Also, I didn't find anything unusual from the instance console logs like OOM killer (as the logs are older) but I can see that the various services have failed to start.  Generally, the instance status check failure detect problems that require your involvement to repair from your end. Instance status check failure can be caused by many reasons such as :          - Startup configuration         - Exhausted resources likes memory, CPU, disk etc.         - Corrupted file system         - Incompatible kernel (Operating System itself)         - Some custom-script causing the issue  https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/system-reachability-check/          Please allow me to convey to you that under AWS data privacy[3] and our Shared responsibility model[4], AWS Support engineers do not have any access or visibility to the data, configurations, processes or applications running inside the instance.

It was my absolute pleasure assisting you on this case today.  Please refer to the brief summary of our discussion.  You have contacted us that EC2 instances running SUSE 15 SP 2 (e.g i-0a9ff84002259131d ) will not registered to SUSE Public Cloud Update infrastructure.  You had mentioned that, you have already tried to re-register using the ""registercloudguest --force-new"" command, however, the instance wasn't registered yet.  Further, you confirmed the yast and zypper commands are not working due to the registration issue. Here are some possible reasons for the SUSE registration fails.  1- EC2 instance is in a private subnet without internet connection 2 - EC2 instance is in a public subnet but without a public IP address, or without proper internal routing 3 - Missing billingProducts code:  # curl -s http://169.254.169.254/latest/dynamic/instance-identity/document | grep -i billing billingProducts"" : [ ""bp-6ca54005"" ], This is can happen if the customer creates a snapshot from the root volume and manually register an AMI  Upon checking the instance details, I have noticed that instance was launched in the public subnet, however, there is no public IP assigned to that. Therefore, I advised to assign the public IP address and re-register the instance, after that, everything was started working fine.  At this moment, I shall mark this case as resolved.

To summarize our discussion on the session : You were unable to connect to the instance via Session Manager.   The instances were in a private subnet and thus, I mentioned that we would need to create VPC endpoints[1] so that instances can connect to SSM and we can then access them via Session Manager. Once we created the endpoints and configured the relevant security group with subnet CIDR of the subnet to which instances belonged, you were able to access them via Session Manager.  However, this broke the session manager access for other instances in this VPC. I requested my colleague Romesh to join the call for further assistance and he was able to point out that instead of adding subnet CIDR in the security group of VPC endpoint, we should add the VPC CIDR. Once we did that, the access to instances via Session Manager was restored for all the instances.   As discussed on call, I am marking the case as resolved. In case of any queries/concerns in future, please do reach out to us again via Support Centre.  We are always happy to help. Have a great day ahead!

It was a pleasure to assist you on the chat session. Please find a summary below.   You reached out to us as you were seeing some stale env variable entries in your instance after you had removed it from the /etc/profile and then sourced the file. You wanted to remove it without a reboot.   As mentioned over the chat session, if removing parameters from /etc/profile and sourcing the file is not working, then there are two option   - create a new session  - unset the env variable  -  unset http_proxy  Both these options don't need a reboot and you should see the effect immediately  There are some scenarios when removing the parameters from the /etc/profile and running source /etc/profile may not work and in such cases the above methods need to be used. In your case, using unset has removed the env variable and the new session also worked.   As discussed on the chat, I am marking the case as resolved.

My name is Rohit and I'll be assisting you with this case today.  From the case description, I infer that you have requested insight regarding getting details of your EC2 instances after they have been terminated. As you have intended to collect the IP and tags of these instances, you have inquired regarding the feasibility of this procedure. Please correct me if I misunderstood your query.  As per your concern, since the instances will be terminated, it will be removed from the console. Hence, there is no direct procedure to obtain the details regarding the instance using an API call such as DescribeTags or DescribeInstances.   However, I was able to check that, if enabled, AWS CloudWatch records and monitors the AWS API calls made to the resources. Here, the instance is provisioned with all these specification right from the launch time, you may be able to retrieve these details using CloudTrail logs here.   Using CloudTrail, if the instance was created in the last 90 days, you can get the information you want from Cloudtrail dashboard itself by searching for the RunInstances API call for the time the instance was created. You can query the Cloudtrail logs using Athena as discussed in the reference below:    https://docs.aws.amazon.com/athena/latest/ug/cloudtrail-logs.html  This procedure enhances your analysis of AWS service activity. For example, you can use queries to identify trends and further isolate activity by attributes.  However, if the instance was started more than 90 days ago, it will not be a feasible option to retrieve these details from the CloudTrail dashboard.  You can only retrieve these details if you have CloudTrail enabled and configured to write to S3 bucket. You can then go through the Cloudtrail logs and isolate for events related the instance id.

I'm Tejas from EC2 Linux team and I will be assisting you with the case today.  I understand that you want to know if it is possible to install packages in the Linux system by creating any endpoint without opening port 80 to the internet (no internet connection). Please correct me if I am wrong.  This is possible in Amazon Linux 1/ 2 as Amazon Linux repositories are hosted in Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) buckets which can be reached via VPC endpoints, please refer [1] for details. (this will only work for the default repo, not for any custom or third party repos such as EPEL)  For other distribution, you do need one of these:  1) Route to the internet (IGW attached) [2] 2) VPN/Direct Connect connection to your data center that routes the yum request through the public internet [3] 3) NAT gateway [4] 4) NAT instance [5]  If there are some specific packages needed (telnet), I would suggest to create an AMI of your instance, launch it in public subnet, install what ever is needed and then create a final AMI of this instance and then launch that instance in private subnet with no internet, this will gave you the required packages installed in the instance.   I trust the aforementioned information was helpful to you.  In the meantime, If you have any follow-up questions/queries, please do not hesitate to reach out and we will be happy to assist. I wish you a safe and a pleasant day ahead!

I understand the you wanted to know the cause of the slowness you observed on your EC2 instance i-052626c80f61de1eb for the past week. And, you wanted to know the IOPS performance on the EBS volumes you mentioned.  I reviewed the EBS metrics of the EC2 instance together with the volumes you mentioned between 2021-03-01 to 2021-03-08. While there are indications of possible EC2 instance level EBS throughput limit hit (e.g. r4.8xlarge is 875MBps), however, I can not confirm this yet because I do not have the exact timeframe when the slowness was observed from your end. Same with the EBS volumes mentioned, I can see some of the volumes going beyond their baseline IOPS but again, I'm not sure whether these had impacts and/or coincide to the time of the slowness you experienced.  That being said, kindly provide the below information. This will help us analyze further and narrow down the investigation.  1. Exact time, date and timezone when the slowness was observed. If the slowness was experienced several date or time, please send it as well. 2. If you have iostat metrics output in 1-second granularity taken during the time of the slowness, that would be great. Please send it as well, but if none then it should be okay.  Moreover, I did not find any underlying hardware issues affecting the EC2 instance in the past week.  Kindly reply back to the case so that we can continue the analysis on the EC2 instance and the volumes mentioned. I hope to hear back from you soon.  We value your feedback.

It was a pleasure. Here is a recap of our conversation.  You opened the case looking for help changing the time zone settings on your instance. Your domain user, even being administrator, wasnt able to change the setting in the GUI.  During our screen share session, I noticed that the server was a domain joined server and that the settings console for time was managed by your domain.  I asked you to run the following command using powershell as administrator: Set-TimeZone -Name ""India Standard Time""  The above command successfully changed the Time Zone of your server.  Then I informed that you can review the TZ settings in powershell by running Get-TimeZone.  Finally, you can check with your domain admin if the TZ settings (in the Windows settings) could be enabled for your servers if you wish to use the GUI next time [1]. Otherwise, you could just use the commands I shared with you above.  Again, it was a pleasure working with you in this request, and as I informed in the chat, I will mark this case as resolved, but if you have any related question, feel free to contact me. I will be happy to help.  Have a great day ahead!

Kindly find below summary of our discussion.  You were concerned about executing the following command, where it succeeds when executed at the CFN Stack creation, but fails with the below error when executed during the stack update:  !Join ["""", [""hostnamectl set-hostname --static"", "" "", !Ref InstanceName, "".AIRVISTARA.COM""]] Could not set property: Connection timed out  In this regard, I recommended you reach out to our CFN Team for more effective assistance in this regard. Reviewing the other case, I could see that the command executes successfully with no errors when run directly through an SSH Terminal. Hence, my colleague Ali would be performing some tests form their side, and will reach you back through the other case.[1] Kindly find below references, discussing how to assign a static hostname to an Amazon EC2 instance running RHEL.[2-4]   I have linked both cases with each other. I will keep this case opened for now, to offer further assistance from our side if required. I hope the provided information prove useful to you.

I would like to give you a summary of our interaction.   You contacted AWS when you mentioned you were not able to reach some ports on your instance [i-0707baad96252acdb] from instances even in the same VPC.  On the chat, we found out that the ports were reachable internally as the services were running appropriately. However, when you tried reaching the IP and ports from your bastion host [ i-08baf9f97e71d7fd0] in subnet-67c7730e you were unable to connect although the security groups were configured correctly.  On the chat I suggested we confirmed from the Windows firewall configuration if no incoming ports were being blocked. We confirmed that although the Private network profile was off, the Guest and Public network profile was turned on. You went ahead to turn off this profile on the Windows Firewall and you were able to successfully reach your instance on the desired ports from the other subnets.   As agreed on the chat, I will kindly resolve this case. However, if you have any issues in relation with this case, you may kindly reach out to us and we will be glad to assist you.   Thank you.

It's my understanding that you have extended the root EBS volume vol-0a51ca65d447402cc of instance i-022f447bd3b1dceee and now the instance is unreachable.  Taking a look at Cloud Watch, I can see instance status check failure events logged starting at 2021-03-16 13:30 UTC [1]. This is what I can see from the latest console output:  BIG-IQ 7.1.0 Build 0.0.1511 Kernel 2.6.32-431.56.1.el6.f5.x86_64 on an x86_64 ip-172-10-88-113 login:  Recommendation: Instance status check failures in this case indicate an OS-level configuration issue (networking configuration, ssh keys, etc.). The only visibility I have currently into the state of the OS is the console output since last reboot. Please review the following log directories and files during the times above for potential causes: /var/log, /var/log/messages  These are the common reasons for failed system checks [2]:      * Failed system status checks     * Incorrect networking or startup configuration     * Exhausted memory     * Corrupted file system     * Incompatible kernel      1. Revert to a recent snapshot of the instance if one is available to return to an operation state     2. If no snapshot is available, try rebooting the instance to see if services start     3. Recover access to the instance by mounting the volume to another instance [3]         3.1 Stop the instance         3.2 Detach the root volume [4]         3.3 Attach it on to a different instance as a secondary volume [5]         3.4 Mount the secondary volume and review the system logs  If you have additional questions as youre going through this process, please feel free to contact us. As an Enterprise Support customer, chat and phone support is available to you, which may be necessary to work through individual troubleshooting steps.

9119,8121745821,TataSky Ltd,Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2 - Windows),APAC,INDIA,cmmayal,"Good day Nasreen,  Christian here again.  You reached out because you are unable to retrieve the EC2 console password i-0fe82c1f5b5ab9532.  After investigation I saw that the instance was created from a custom AMI ""ami-007c7de6d1f716f78"" and I've explained that when a new instance is launched from an Amazon provided AMI's, EC2Launch service is configured to generate a random password from the console.  However, after you launch the instance, this setting will be disabled on EC2Launch and you will need to enable it before creating a custom AMI. If this setting is not enabled on EC2Launch before creating the AMI, the old password is captured as part of the AMI creation process and that password cannot be retrieved from the console.  Please refer to the article [1] for recommended process of creating Windows based AMIs.   If you don't have the password of the parent instance, you'll have to reset the password.  You can reset the password using AWS System Manager, however this requires the instance to be managed by Systems Manager and refer to article [2] for AWS Systems Manager prerequisites.  Alternatively you can use the EC2Recsue tool for offline method:  EC2Rescue(Offline) []: 1. Stop the problematic instance. 2. Launch temporary Windows instance (Helper instances) in the same subnet with i-0fe82c1f5b5ab9532 3. Detach the root volume from problematic instance and attach it with your newly created instance as secondary volume (device: xvdf). 4. Connect to the helper instance using RDP . 5. Download and extract EC2rescue tool. You can download the EC2Rescue software using link [3].  6. Click through until you see the choices for Current Instance or Offline Instance. 7. Select Offline Instance. 8. Select the affected disk. Ideally this will be the only other disk besides the root volume and as such should be the only option to select. 9. Once the volume is successfully loaded, select Diagnose and Rescue. 10. You'll see a list of things that can be fixed. 11.

I understand your instance i-08c79aef57db2fa2a had a status check failed alert and you would like to know the reason behind it.   I had a look at the underlying hardware first to see if there were any issues at the underlying hardware level that would have generated the status check failed alert. I found out that the underlying hardware went into unhealthy state at the time you mentioned and caused the instance to fail status checks. I got the CloudWatch graph of the underlying hardware and it shows the status check failure.   https://ap-south-1.console.aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/home?region=ap-south-1#metricsV2:graph=~(metrics~(~(~'AWS*2fEC2~'StatusCheckFailed_System~'InstanceId~'i-08c79aef57db2fa2a))~stat~'Sum~period~300~start~'2021-03-18T01*3a44*3a13.247Z~end~'2021-03-19T01*3a44*3a13.247Z~region~'ap-south-1)  Since the instance was stopped and started, it has now moved on to a new and healthy host.

Regarding to copy backup file slowness, I would suggest you follow below instruction to optimize your instances:  - You can try enabling the jumbo frame at source and destination servers.    [+] Network maximum transmission unit (MTU) for your EC2 instance  - Check and set the MTU on your Windows instance - https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/WindowsGuide/network_mtu.html#set_mtu_windows   - To achieve the maximum network performance on instances with enhanced networking, you may need to modify the default operating system configuration. We recommend the following configuration changes for applications that require high network performance. Other optimizations (such as turning on checksum offloading and enabling RSS, for example) are already in place on official Windows AMIs.

While on the call, you mentioned that you were having issues logging into your instance (i-04027804dc00cd444) when trying to use the local Administrator account with the password generated from the Key Pair.  To resolve this issue, we were able to modify the EC2Config settings manually and regenerate the password using the Key Pair. A recap of the steps are below:  1. Create/Use a recovery instance in the same availability zone as your affected instance. 2. Stop the instance and detach the root volume. 3. Attach the root volume of the affected instance to your recovery instance. 4. Open Disk management by running Start > Run > diskmgmt.msc. 5. Right click on the volume and bring the volume online. 6. Edit the config.xml located on offline volume in D:\Program Files\Amazon\Ec2ConfigService\Settings 7. Change Ec2SetPassword from Disabled to Enabled. Save and close the file. This value is set to Disabled after the next boot of the instance. 8. To avoid disk signature collision issue, you may have to run EC2Rescue tool from https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/ec2rescue-windows-troubleshoot/ and simply run      through the wizard until you see the EC2Rescue exit window with an option to Fix disk signature. 9. Detach the offline root volume and attach it to your instance as /dev/sda1. 10. Start the instance and use Get Windows Password to decrypt the new default Administrator password.  It seemed at first this method failed, and even EC2Rescue[1] did not seem to enable this option. After doing it for a second time it seemed to take the setting, and finally we were able to log in.  I am glad we were able to resolve this issue. As per our call, I will go ahead and resolve this case.

9251,8163644841,Compass Group Holdings PLC,Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2 - Linux),APAC,INDIA,disriniv,"Hello Athira,  This is Divya again from AWS Support. Thank you for your response. I apologize for the delay in my response as I was thoroughly analysing all the logs and the reports that were sent previously.   To reiterate, you mentioned that you were unable to see the memory utilization reported for the instance i-006fb0e6eca439bd2 and it was not captured from 16:34 UTC to 1:49 UTC on 29th March 2021. As all other metrics were captured and only the memory utilization wasnt, I requested you to send the atop logs captured during that time frame.   Since the historical atop results and the log uploaded only consists the information about the CPU Utilization and not memory consumption, Im unable to further analyse the memory consumption during that time frame to debug further. Thats correct, I just installed atop on my test instance and replicated and for only live monitoring, we run the command $ atop -m which would launch the memory information.  I further analysed the complete /var/log/messages file and did not notice any Out of memory messages too that would depict that the system was under memory pressure.   As I mentioned in my responses previously, I can confirm that there were no AWS Infrastructure issues too during that time frame. Hence from my analyzation so far, I believe that the Instance was unresponsive during the time frame due to a resource glitch due to which the memory utilization metrics werent reported. However as the atop logs does not report the memory utilization then, I am still unable to confirm this.  Hence we would have to wait for the issue if it occurs again, to capture the atop -m live memory utilization and if the message logs reflect Out of memory messages to analyse further.

This is Jason with a recap of our conversation.  You got in touch as you could not see the GPU listed in Task Manager on your G4DN instance with the Tesla drivers installed.  The documentation contains the steps for installing the public Tesla drivers and some steps to take after installation:  Install NVIDIA drivers on Windows instances  - Option 2: Public NVIDIA drivers - https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/WindowsGuide/install-nvidia-driver.html#public-nvidia-driver   After installing the NVIDIA drivers, it should be noted that if you are connecting to the instance with RDP (mstsc), the GPU will not be available through RDP.  In order to see the GPU, you need to connect with another remote desktop tool, such as TightVNC:  TightVNC download - http://tightvnc.com/download.php  This is also covered in the documentation here:  https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/WindowsGuide/accelerated-computing-instances.html  ""When using Microsoft Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP), GPUs that use the WDDM driver model are replaced with a non-accelerated Remote Desktop display driver. We recommend that you use a different remote access tool to access your GPU, such as Teradici Cloud Access Software, NICE Desktop Cloud Visualization (DCV), or VNC. You can also use one of the GPU AMIs from the AWS Marketplace because they provide remote access tools that support 3D acceleration.""   So please ensure you are not connecting with Microsoft RDP, as the GPU will not be available using this connection method.

9273,8165374601,Mylan,Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2 - Linux),APAC,INDIA,jkkevan,"Hello,  I have heard back from the internal team on this issue. There is no specific recommendation for timeouts from the team, as timeouts for a large number of snapshots is the expected behavior. However the internal team has recommended the following:  ""suggested to use pagination in Boto3. ( Pagination is the the process of sending subsequent requests to continue where a previous request left off. ) Describing an excessive amount of EBS snapshots in an account should be done using pagination to avoid timeout here. See following example:  def getSnapshots(token = """"):          response=client.describe_snapshots(OwnerIds=['0123456789'],MaxResults=5,NextToken=token)     fileWrite(json.dumps(response, indent=4, sort_keys=True, default=str))      try:         NextToken = response['NextToken']         if(NextToken!=""""):             getSnapshots(NextToken)     except:         return  There is no optimal timeout value, it is expected to see the timeout with so many EBS snapshots.""

9282,8165545751,One97 Communications Limited,Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2 - Linux),APAC,INDIA,waltmw,"Hi Ashish  Michael here from AWS, thanks for reaching out today.  You were experiencing instance status check failures with your instance - i-0c0f01f63d0f1630e.  Checking the instance status check CloudWatch metric, I saw that there were failures between 2021-03-30 11:25 UTC - 12:35 UTC [1]. Instance status check failures are an indication that an issue at the OS level has resulted in your instance becoming unreachable [2]. Looking further into the metrics we noticed a spike in disk read/write activity on the root EBS volume - vol-01c2cb53397e7f1e4 [3] during the above time frame.  Using my internal tools to check further into the issue, I identified that the EBS volume faced issues around the same time that the instance failed instance status checks. When your OS processes/services faced issues writing to the root volume due to the issue facing the underlying EBS volume, they may have timed out and caused system instability and resulting in the instance status check failing. As I mentioned at the end of our chat, I've reached out to our internal EBS team to review the EBS volume - vol-01c2cb53397e7f1e4. I'll provide their feedback to you via this case as soon as I hear back from them. In the mean time I'll set the case status to Pending Amazon Action, should you have any other questions feel free to let me know and I'll be happy to assist. Have a good day further Ashish, and keep safe.

I am following up regarding our discussion earlier.  To summarize, you mentioned that you were unable to change the instance type of the instance i-007a06878ff1752c4. You were suspecting it might be related to a pending AMI creation of the instance.  I had a look at the instance. The instance was stopped. A pending AMI creation should not be preventing you from changing the instance type of a stopped instance. However, you mentioned that you had hibernation enabled for the instance. Please note that it is not possible to change the instance type of an instance with hibernation enabled. Please refer to this link [1] for reference. Furthermore, it is not possible to disable hibernation on an instance [2].  You will have to restore a new instance from your AMI with a larger size. The AMI has finished completion and is now available.  As discussed, I am going to mark this case as resolved.

You contacted the support line as even though you had path based rule for your Application Load Balancer (ALB), some queries were failing after appending anything to v1.  Reviewing your ALB rqi1stop-qa-use1-alb, I found out that you had a path based rule to forward any traffics with /v1* to rqi1stop-qa-use1-tg-https and rqi1stop-qa-use1-cron-api-https, however it was only working for v1 alone and failing with 404 after adding any characters after v1.

I just wanted to send a short follow up summarizing what we spoke about today on chat.  You opened the chat because you still not able to connect to address outlook.office365.com port 993 via your proxy/squid instance [ i-0495796bcddc30edb ], even after added port 993 to Squid Safe_ports configuration.  Before we proceed with the troubleshoot, I pointed out that troubleshooting 3rd party applications (like Squid) is considered system administration tasks, which is not covered under AWS Premium support scope [01].  Even though troubleshooting 3rd party application is out of AWS support scope, I was very happy to help in troubleshooting the issue, as best effort basis.  Moving forward, since you are connecting to IMAP on port 993, which utilizes SSL/TLS, you also had to allow port 993 in Squid SSL_ports configuration.  Additionally, after you add the configuration ""acl SSL_ports port 993"" to Squid ""/etc/squid/squid.conf"", I asked you to check and reconfigure squid in order to apply new config. For your reference I'm sharing the command:    # Display Squid configuration ""squid.conf""   sudo grep -v ^# /etc/squid/squid.conf |grep .    # Check if there are any error in squid.conf ( useful to validate squid config before reload )   sudo squid -k check    # Reload Squid configuration ( It will apply the configuration without need to restart Squid service )   sudo squid -k reconfigure   Moreover, after reconfigure Squid, we checked Squid logs ""/var/log/squid/access.log"" while run curl command in the instance i-0a883e4fcb5cf895a, and we confirmed that curl was using proxy to successfully access outlook.office365.com on port 993.    # Watch Squid logs in order to confirm that outlook.office365.com port 993 is allowed (run this command in proxy instance)   sudo tail -f /var/log/squid/access.log |grep office365    # While command above is running, we tested connection in the instance i-0a883e4fcb5cf895a using curl command   curl -Ik https://outlook.office365.com:993   Las",4/1/2021 0:00,4/7/2021 0:00,RE:[CASE 8174454551] Chat: unable to telnet outlook.office365.com 993 from server ip-172-22-161-249,4,"outlook.office365.com,outlook.office365.com,outlook.office365.com,https://outlook.office365.com:993",amrit wa pleasure chatting today wanted send short follow summarizing spoke today chat opened chat still able connect address port via proxy squid instance even added port squid configuration proceed troubleshoot pointed troubleshooting party application like squid considered system administration task covered aws premium support scope even though troubleshooting party application aws support scope wa happy help troubleshooting issue best effort basis moving forward since connecting imap port utilizes ssl tl also allow port squid configuration additionally add configuration acl port squid asked check reconfigure squid order apply new config reference sharing command display squid configuration squid conf sudo grep grep check error squid conf useful validate squid config reload sudo squid check reload squid configuration apply configuration without need restart squid service sudo squid reconfigure moreover reconfigure squid checked squid log run curl command instance confirmed curl wa using proxy successfully access port watch squid log order confirm port allowed run command proxy instance sudo tail grep command running tested connection instance using curl command curl http,9,pleasure premium inconvenience underlying feel contacting hope happy conversation chatting corner incoming reviewed star rated experience ahead rating assisting talking

My name is Arti from Linux Support Team and I will be assisting you today.   From the case notes I understand that you would like to apply password while launching EC2 instances from the images(AMIs) which are created using lambda function. Please correct me if I have misunderstood your use case.  In order to assist you with your query I did some research and I found that you can use multi-factor authentication (MFA) to achieve your use case. That is you can enable multi-factor authentication [1] for the users and then you can configure MFA-protected API access for those users [2]. This will provide an additional security of requiring users to be authenticated with AWS multi-factor authentication (MFA) before you allow them to perform particularly sensitive actions (like launching, stopping or terminating instances).   Since in your use case you want to restrict EC2 launch instances access and as you might be aware that for launching EC2 instances RunInstances API operations is being called therefore you can create an IAM policy which will explicitly Deny RunInstnaces API operations if the user is not authenticated using multi-factor authentication (MFA). Further you can refer this document [3] which shows an example of an IAM policy providing MFA-protected API access.  I hope you have found above information helpful. In case of any additional queries or concerns please feel free to revert back and I will be happy to assist you further.  Thank You! Have a nice day ahead!

9400,8202522191,Jubilant FoodWorks Limited,Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2 - Windows),APAC,INDIA,kcomali,"Hello Janardhan,   Kyler here from AWS Premium Support. Thank you for your time on Chat today.   You reached out because your instance i-0cd325021dfc8e4d6 was in a stopped state from yesterday, and you would like to know the root cause for this.  Upon chat I've checked the Cloudtrail logs, and found a 'StopInstances' call made to the above mentioned instance at 2021-04-08T13:57:23Z at Event ID (dbe932f8-2958-4c40-b2c4-1f8734172c94). Please see find the link to the Cloudtrail event below:   https://ap-south-1.console.aws.amazon.com/cloudtrail/home?region=ap-south-1#/events?StartTime=2021-04-06T07:15:57.392Z&EndTime=2021-04-09T07:15:57.392Z&EventName=StopInstances  After further review of the instance, I noticed that the CPU of the EC2 instance reached and stayed at 100% which can be seen from the Cloudwatch metrics below:  https://ap-south-1.console.aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/deeplink.js?region=ap-south-1#metricsV2:graph=%7B%22metrics%22%3A%5B%5B%22AWS%2FEC2%22%2C%22CPUUtilization%22%2C%22InstanceId%22%2C%22i-0cd325021dfc8e4d6%22%5D%5D%2C%22stat%22%3A%22Maximum%22%2C%22period%22%3A300%2C%22start%22%3A%222021-04-08T07%3A28%3A50.750Z%22%2C%22end%22%3A%222021-04-09T07%3A28%3A50.750Z%22%2C%22region%22%3A%22ap-south-1%22%7D  This indicates that something on the operating system was consuming more CPU capability than usual which can result in the EC2 instance to become unreachable. As we do not have visibility into your server's operating system, we're unable to determine the exact reason and increased CPU utilization. I suspect this could be why the instance would have been stopped, as usually a reboot or stop/start of the server can forcefully terminate processes consuming the CPU and help recover access. However, it's best to check with the user that initiated the stop from the console as to why the the instance was stopped.   As discussed on chat, I will be setting the case to resolved.

I will not be able to examine the Network Configuration of that Instance as it is terminated. Could you please confirm if you are still encountering the issue with connectivity.   Make sure ICMP traffic is not blocked on the EC2 Instances   - Security Groups of Destination Instances must allow traffic from IP CIDR or IP Address of the Source Instance. - Ensure that the ICMP traffic is allowed in the Firewall and Antivirus (if any) - You could test by disabling firewall on the destination Instances by running the command in command prompt (run as Administrator): NetSh Advfirewall set allprofiles state off  If you are still encountering any issues please share the Instance ID or Security Group ID, NACL ID (Network Access Control List) for us to examine the rules.

9424,8209347181,ALL_DEPRECATED,Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2 - Linux),APAC,INDIA,btruitt,"Hello Mayur and team,   Brice here.   Thanks for chatting with me today. Here is a summary of the case and chat.   The initial issue was that the NVME devices were not reachable not only the swap device. We were able to see these errors through the console log, in the related case from this morning (8208958021), and during the call.   Eventually we decided to do a stop and start to move the instance to different hardware which is because it was not just one NVME device that was throwing an error but 3 or more. If it were one device it would make sense to investigate just that one EBS volume but since it was different devices I suspected that there was an issue with the underlying hardware. There was no way for me to know at the time if it was truly an underlying hardware problem but the start and stop is a way to test that. The results of the stop and start yielded no device errors and so it is likely the other host had hardware issues and I have let the other team I was working with know.   I did not forget that we had a swap partition issue but I did not count that among the errors above because we found that the device name had changed and that means the incorrect EBS volume was attempting to be mounted as a swap device. The fix for this was to identify the correct block device that mapped to the swap volume with blkid and then modify /etc/fstab to have the UUID of the file system instead of the block device name. The UUID will never change by itself so this is a good way to identify a specific file system the same can be said for file system Labels too.

It was an absolute pleasure to be chatting with you today.   You reached out requesting assistance in order to upgrade Python Installation from version 2.7 to Python 3.0 on EC2 Instance ID ""i-0d6b673f1046d8778"".  During our chat session we confirmed the installed version  of 2.7.6 and I also quickly executed a test on my lab environment running the same Windows Server 2012 R2 as your source instance for the task, Instance ID ""i-0d6b673f1046d8778"".  As a best practice, prior to executing the change you created a Custom Windows AMI[1] of your instance. Meanwhile, I confirmed on my test environment that downloading the Python package for Python 3.0 from [2] allowed the installation to be executed over the current 2.7.6, however, it was required to execute a change on the Windows System Environment Variables[3], as presented below:  From: C:\Python27 To: C:\Python 30  After executing this change, the command ""python -v"" reported the newly installed version 3.0.  Please note, as identified during the Environment Variable changes, there were two additional variables on Python 2.7:  1 - C:\Python27\Scripts  2 - C:\Python27\google-cloud-sdk\bin\  If your Development Team needs to adjust both tools to Python 3.0, the required versions should be installed on C:\Python30\ folder and then change the environment variables on the same steps as before, with the values below:  From: C:\Python27\Scripts  To: C:\Python30\Scripts   From: C:\Python27\google-cloud-sdk\bin\  To: C:\Python30\google-cloud-sdk\bin\   As agreed over chat, as your request was achieved, I am marking this case as resolved.

It was a pleasure chatting with you earlier today.   Below is the summary of our chat:  You reached out to us as you were unable to SSH into your instance ( i-0b8e6d0b9144095a1) and had question regarding the same. As the instance was stopped I was unable to check its details.   However, we launched a new instance (i-0d1668dbe2689fc2f) from AMI and it was working as expected.  Later, you wanted to know why the instance i-0b8e6d0b9144095a1 was not working as expected where as AMI of the instance was working fine.  In order to troubleshoot it, the instance needs to be started, as you had detached its root volume and did not had time to work on it, we decided it will be better for you to reach back to us when you have time.  I am glad that the AMI solution worked well.  Please feel free to reach out to us at any time if you have any further questions or concerns. Thank you and have a great day ahead!

As per our discussion, you have been experiencing some issues when attempting to upgrade the nginx application on your instance.  As per our troubleshooting the error you had received is this:  ============== sudo add-apt-repository ppa:nginx/stable Cannot add PPA: 'ppa:~nginx/ubuntu/stable'. ERROR: '~nginx' user or team does not exist. ==============  I had investigated this on my end, by running the same command on a freshly created instance in my personal lab. The command succeeded on my end. I then found some discussions describing that a proxy might be the reason for the commands failing.  I then did some further research, in order to find a workaround for the issue, and found the nginx documentation here[1], for upgrading nginx on Ubuntu.  I applied the same steps listed in the mentioned documentation to my own instance, and I had been able to successfully upgrade my nginx application from version 1.10, to version 1.18.0.

I have checked within my team and I have found that removing python3 from the instance will break the instance. Further, I would like to inform you that removing python3 package will remove the cloud-init  and several other packages dependent on python3.6 on your operating system. Cloud-init and netplan packages are actually responsible for bringing up the network on ec2-instance and since they have been removed as part of python3 removal, the instance has lost its automatic network loading capability due to missing packages.  On screenshare we have already tried checking the networking configuration and tried fixing the issue however the issue didn't get fixed as it removal of python3 package has broken the instance. Further I would suggest you to create a new instance and copy all your data to this new instnace.  I have also joined the same chime meeting now, so we can connect on call to discuss the same.

9576,8257864901,ALL_DEPRECATED,Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2 - Linux),APAC,INDIA,kiraguek,"Good day,  Thank you for reaching out on chat today. Here is a recap of our conversation.  Issue: You received an alert that one of your instances has inbound security group rules allowing traffic from any source IP address to any port posing a security risk on your environment.  Steps Taken:  We removed the inbound rule on the VPC default security group allowing traffic to any destination port (0-65535). As discussed , your AWS account automatically has a default security group for the default VPC in each Region. If you don't specify a security group when you launch an instance, the instance is automatically associated with the default security group for the VPC [1]. This explains why the elasti-cache ENI has the VPC default security group.  I hope this was helpful. Have a pleasant day further.

I hope this email finds you well!   It was a pleasure having a conversation with you today. This email is a summary of our conversation over chat and screenshare session.  You reached out to us as your instance 'i-063e8c98ade5c66a9' was failing 1/2 status checks.  As discussed on chat, I went ahead and investigated the aforementioned instance and following is what I observed:  1. Status Checks:  ------------------------  System Status Checks are caused due to issues on the hardware. I could see that there were no System Status check failure at the said timestamp,from this I can confirm that there was no issue on the underlying hardware of the System as the system status checks passed and you can also see it from your CloudWatch metrics   The instance status check started to fail at 2021-04-23T06:47:00 UTC for instance 'i-063e8c98ade5c66a9 ' . As you might be aware that Instance Status Checks monitor the software and network configuration of your individual instance. Amazon EC2 checks the health of the instance by sending an address resolution protocol (ARP) request to the ENI. These checks detect problems that require your involvement to repair. When an instance status check fails, typically you will need to address the problem yourself (for example, by rebooting the instance or by making instance configuration changes).  The following are examples of problems that can cause instance status checks to fail:  ===== Failed system status checks.  ------->> This was not the reason here.  Incorrect networking or startup configuration  Exhausted memory  Corrupted file system  Incompatible kernel =====  For more information regarding the Status Checks you can refer to the following AWS Public Documentations :   [+] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/monitoring-system-instance-status-check.html#types-of-instance-status-checks [+] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/TroubleshootingInstances.html  2.

You would like to have someone from support on the call in case there are any issues.  In regards to pre-requisites, these are all listed in the documentation mentioned in the case already. It is highly recommended to take a backup AMI prior to starting for backup incase anything happens during the upgrade.  I would like to mention that we also have an automation for these types of upgrades [1] that will handle all of the necessary tasks to upgrade. Once this automation successfully finishes, your instance should be the upgraded OS. Be sure to login to it and ensure proper functionality with any applications installed as some older applications may need upgrading as well.   In regards to getting an engineer on the call, this timeframe would fall outside my normal working hours (I'm based in the CST time zone). Typically the quickest and easiest method to have an engineer join a call is to initiate a call via the case. I'd recommend opening the call via the case about 15-20 minutes prior to the scheduled meeting to ensure you get an engineer on the phone in time.   Please let me know if you have any other questions or concerns. Have a great rest of the day.

I understand that you observed issue with network drop once again for the following time frame: UTC time frame: 12:35 to 12:40, 13:40 to 13:45  I reviewed the similar information from the EC2 like CPU utilization, network in, network out and status check failure and they seem fine.   At approximately at 13:40 UTC (19:10 IST), there was a transient 3% drop between ap-south-1a and ap-south-1b. However, I did not find any such drops for the  12:35 to 12:40 UTC time frame. All the TCP connections can handle transient packet drop with retransmission. Thus, we need more information about the nature of communication and drop being detected from your side.   In order to troubleshoot further, can you please provide the following information:  1. Where is the network graphs collected?  - I do not see specific mention of any instance id, unit like byte or packets to know what the graph actually refers to. Can you provide detailed description of the provided graphs?  2. How does the packets flow for the specific instance ids provided?  - What is the packet flow in your AWS architecture? Does the provided instances communicate with the same target machine? Are they expected to receive packets from up-stream?   3. If you have not already, please enable VPC flow logs that provides more information on packet flow and any drops. You may review the specific VPC flow logs when the issue was reported for further troubleshooting.  Please confirm if you already enabled/reviewed the VPC flow logs.   4. Check up stream  - If the instances are configured as the targets of the load balancer, check with load balancer and up stream to see if there is any issue reported there. As you have encountered this issue frequently, please feel free to open up a case with load balancer team as well for complete analysis from their side.

9620,8267336221,One97 Communications Limited,Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2 - Linux),APAC,INDIA,simbarb,"Hi,  Thank you for your time on the chat.  Let me summarize what we discussed.  You had a GuardDuty finding ""UnauthorizedAccess:EC2/TorRelay"" for outbound access to IP address 217.155.40.118.  On the chat we checked on the running processes and current network connections to confirm if there was anything still connected to that IP and we did not find anything suspicious.  As discussed on the chat to review network connection there is need to log network traffic with tools like tcpdump on the instance at the OS level or VPC flow logs[1] at the network interface(ENI) level.  During the chat I confirmed that the domain pyro.eu.org has the IP address 217.155.40.118 and access to that domain, for example to a project like https://pyro.eu.org/projects/html2pdf, would trigger this finding as the IP address is also associated with the Tor network.  On the chat you confirmed that you will check with your team if there was any access to that domain or project.  If you confirm that there was access to this domain and you need to continue to access it, you can implement a suppression rule[2] based on the criteria - finding type ""UnauthorizedAccess:EC2/TorRelay"" and the remote IP address ""217.155.40.118"".   I trust this additional information is useful and please do reach out back on the case with your findings and we can continue with the investigation and troubleshooting if required.

The instance ""1-0812e232104f2f48f"" gets stop/started automatically via the lambda function. When the instance started today morning, you found that some of the Application services were not started on this machine ""i-0812e232104f2f48f"". But, when try to resolve the issue by restarting the service, that seem caused the issue on the production server ""i-0f7b2e7735aa0387e"" application.   As we don't have any specific logs for the application side, we tried to review the system logs (/var/log/messages) and observed the application going to unresponsive state for some reason which correlated to the time you tried restart the service on backup instance.  Doing some research, we found that EFS file system was not mounted on the backup instance that could have caused the issue with backup instance ""i-0812e232104f2f48f"" application. And we were able to mount the filesystem manually now. However, we could not pinpoint the exact issue occurred on the production instance.   Since, we did not get the more reason for the issue, you will replicate the issue and see if the issue reproduces during non-business hours. If the issue replicates again, I request you to please reach us via the phone or chat support so that, we can live troubleshoot the",5/4/2021 0:00,5/4/2021 0:00,RE:[CASE 8297359711] Chat: BO Instance communication with Backup server,2,,hello amrutha vediyappan aws premium support wa pleasure assisting case today please refer brief summary discussion contacted application running production instance wa affected try attempt fix application level issue another instance today need get assistance narrow issue firstly confirmed mentioned instance running two separate availability zone security group doe allow connection mentioned instance wa launched backup image instance wa running long instance get stop started automatically via lambda function instance started today morning found application service started machine try resolve issue restarting service seem caused issue production server application specific log application side tried review system log observed application going unresponsive state reason correlated time tried restart service backup instance research found efs file system wa mounted backup instance could caused issue backup instance application able mount filesystem manually however could pinpoint exact issue occurred production instance since get reason issue replicate issue see issue reproduces non business hour issue replicates request please reach via phone chat support live troubleshoot,9,pleasure premium inconvenience underlying feel contacting hope happy conversation chatting corner incoming reviewed star rated experience ahead rating assisting talking

You contacted AWS Premium Support to open the following ports for the instance  i-0fca7c0d542f92704.  ========== 80  7171  8050  8181   ==========  On the chat, you informed me that you had opened the aforementioned ports and wanted to validate if the ports were open successfully. I reviewed the instance i-0fca7c0d542f92704 and the security group (sg-06da4f0014b485f0e ) associated with the instance. I then confirmed that the ports were successfully added to the security group.

I then informed you that the ports were opened with the source set to 0.0.0.0/0 which meant the source machine could be anywhere on the internet. Hence, I recommended you to review the usage and the application running on the instance to gauge if any changes in the security group would be needed.

I can understand the inconvenience this would have caused you. Please accept our sincerest apologies. We try our best to restrict the downtime caused by such failures to be very brief.  Now, when running latency-sensitive workload in the future, please consider increasing the instance size, or using dedicated host based or bare metal instances.  I hope it helps, Please let me know if you need anything else. I will be happy to help.  We value your feedback.

9795,8323551251,Juspay Technologies Pvt Ltd,Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2 - Linux),APAC,INDIA,shizha,"Hello Sai,   Thanks for contacting AWS Premium Support.   First of all, I apologize on behalf of AWS for the delay in getting back to you, this is due to the influx of cases we had recently.  On reviewing the case, I understand that the instance i-0a1012613da387a5a has been detached from the auto scaling group (ASG) jp-envoy-webserver-asg-v2 at 2021-04-16T03:24:43 UTC (2021-04-16T08:54+5:30) in response to a user request, shrinking the capacity from 5 to 4.  However, it is found later that the instance was still attached to the load balancer ec-webserver-prod-apsouth1-elb after the ASG detach event. You would like to know why this instance was not attached to the ASG but registered with the load balancer.   Please let me know if I missed or misunderstood anything.   I reviewed CloudTrail event history [1] by filtering Resource Name as the ELB name ""ec-webserver-prod-apsouth1-elb"". Then I checked all the events whose name is ""RegisterInstancesWithLoadBalancer"" since the above ASG detach event at 2021-04-16T08:54+5:30. This is because RegisterInstancesWithLoadBalancer is the API used to register an EC2 instance to a load balancer [2,3].   For each event ""RegisterInstancesWithLoadBalancer"", I look at the section called ""Request Parameters"" which gives instance ID(s) to be registered under this API call [3].   I found after the instance was detached from the ASG at 2021-04-16T08:54+5:30, the instance was registered several times by a user named gaurav.ranjan. For example: --------------------------- At 2021-04-23T18:44:07.00 UTC, the user gaurav.ranjan registered the instance i-0a1012613da387a5a to the ELB ec-webserver-prod-apsouth1-elb; Event ID: b075f19e-75c8-4b14-b973-5ff88066555e   --------------------------- At 2021-04-23T19:10:33.00 UTC, the user gaurav.ranjan deregistered the instance from the ELB.

I just wanted to send a short follow up summarizing what we spoke about today on chat.  You opened the chat because you launched a new instance from the community AMI ""ami-0b3acf3edf2397475"", which has the description below:      ""SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 15 Service Pack 2 (HVM), EBS General Purpose (SSD) Volume Type. Amazon EC2 AMI Tools preinstalled; Apache 2.2, MySQL 5.5, PHP 5.3, and Ruby 1.8.7 available.""   Hence, you are expecting to have ""Apache 2.2, MySQL 5.5, PHP 5.3, and Ruby 1.8.7"" package preinstalled. However, upon checking the description closely, it says that:      Amazon EC2 AMI Tools preinstalled;     Apache 2.2, MySQL 5.5, PHP 5.3, and Ruby 1.8.7 available.   Therefore, it means that Amazon EC2 AMI Tools are preinstalled, while those packages (Apache 2.2, MySQL 5.5, PHP 5.3, and Ruby 1.8.7) are available for installation.  Last but not least, I've launched a test instance based on the same AMI (ami-0b3acf3edf2397475) on my own account, and I confirmed that those package are not preinstalled, however they are available for installation.  Moreover, in order to install those packages you can use zypper command, as you can see in the example below:      sudo zypper install -y apache2 apache2-mod_php7 php7 php7-mysql mariadb ruby   Finally, if you want to have an AMI with those packages preinstalled, you can launch a new instance from this AMI (ami-0b3acf3edf2397475), then, run the zypper command above to install those package, and finally create a new AMI from launched instance. For more information regarding to create new AMI from your instance, please refer to the link below:    - https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/creating-an-ami-ebs.html#how-to-create-ebs-ami   I hope you find the above information useful.

You reached out to us as you were unable to ssh into the instance i-029330b72dff0065b after resizing it due to connection refused error.   I went ahead and inspected the console logs for the instance and I could see the below error:  [FAILED] Failed to mount /anon-ci_mountpoint1.  Such errors are usually seen due to automount failures because of incorrect or erroneous entries in /etc/fstab. More details regarding this can be found in below document: https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/ec2-linux-emergency-mode/  So, you suspected that this issue could be due to changing the instance type and you tried changing it back to the original type c4.8xlarge and you were able to connect via telnet. However, for ssh you were receiving a different error related to key. So, the earlier connection refused error was no longer occurring. So, you mentioned that you will check with your team who works on this instance to check if they are able to connect and reach back in case of any issues.  I hope our session helpful.

""Permission denied (publickey)"" and ""Authentication failed, permission denied"" errors occur if[1]: - You're trying to connect using the wrong user name for your AMI. - The permissions are incorrect on the instance. - The incorrect SSH public key (.pub) file is in the authorized_keys file.  Resolution  1. Verify that you're using the correct user name for your AMI  I see that it is a Red hat instance. For a RHEL AMI, the user name is ec2-user or root by default[2]  2. Verify that the instance's permissions are correct and that the correct SSH public key is in the authorized_keys file  You can address this issue by using 2 options listed in the link [1]. That is: - Method 4: Use a user data script to repair SSH permissions and add the correct SSH public key to the authorized_keys file - Method 2. However for method 2, you will need to use SSH instead of SSM, Please find the details below: ----------------------- 1. Stop the current instance i-02c44bea58e33455c (assume Instance A)  2. Detach the root volume 'vol-0fa036de67a5d5d22 ' (sda1) from instance A.     a. Go to ""Volumes"" in navigation pane.     b. Select the relevant volume.     c. ""Action"" -> ""Detach Volume"".  3.

During the chat and call we discussed that you have an autoscaling group that spins up instances for you and the same usedata script that was use to spin up instance on April 30 is no longer work and AWS CLI is not getting installed.  During the call we reviewed the output of cloud-init log of the working and non working instances.

We could also see errors in updating pip. Hence we manually update pip using the following commands.  # /bin/curl -O https://bootstrap.pypa.io/pip/2.7/get-pip.py  # python get-pip.py  Since the latest version of AWS CLI v1 was having issues in installation, we reviewed the version of AWS CLI on the working instance and installed the specific version of AWS CLI using the following command.  # pip install awscli==1.19.69 --upgrade  You were able to update the userdata script with the above commands which resolved all issues.

You needed to delete this volume but before deletion you wanted to confirm if any data resides in the volume or not, but the the mount command was failing to mount the filesystem on the volume.  We initiated a screen-share session to troubleshoot the issue.  Before proceeding, I advised that this activity is a system admin task and is out of scope of support [1], AWS is responsible for protecting the infrastructure that runs all of the services offered in the AWS Cloud, but customers are responsible for patching and configuration of their OS and applications. Please see the shared responsibility model for more details [2]. However, I was happy to help but the suggestions provided by us should be considered on a best-effort basis only.

We checked command history for root user (hdpmaster) using below commands:            - set date format for history commands using below command:          export HISTTIMEFORMAT=%F %T""       - search for rm command in command history with below command:             history | grep rm            that showed rm command for file '2021-03-31_01-00_databackup_3_1', however tha was for couple of months ago.   We checked command history for ec2-user (default user), but we could see last modification time for ~ec2-user/.bash_history is old (last year) that make sense as you mentioned you do not use ec2-user for login to the instance.  Additionally, we checked if the file might be moved to another path using command `sudo find / -name '2021-03-31_01-00_databackup_3_1 2>/dev/null` but it return nothing. I checked instance details and I could not find EBS snapshots created for LVM volume mountpoint /backup.  As you know, per privacy and security concerns[1] AWS Premium Support Engineers have no visibility to running applications nor files exist inside EC2 instance for our customers, however I tried to help based on my best effort. I shared with you links[2,3] that could help with using xfs_undelete that tries to recover all files on an XFS filesystem marked as deleted. As best practise, I would recommend you to create instance AMI[4] or EBS snapshots[5] as a backup before install and work with xfs_undelete.  In order to tarck coming user activity, you can consider work with Auditd[6] service that collect and write log files of audit to the disk as a background service for ",5/17/2021 0:00,5/17/2021 0:00,RE:[CASE 8348254461] Chat: Query on how the data got deleted,2,,greeting utkarsh wa pleasure chatting today provide summary conversation contacted file wa deleted ec2 instance would like help get information via screen sharing session shared find relevant message deleting file message log file wa around checked command history root user hdpmaster using command set date format history command using command export histtimeformat search command command history command history grep showed command file however wa couple month ago checked command history ec2 user default user could see last modification time old last year make sense mentioned use ec2 user login instance additionally checked file might moved another path using command sudo find return nothing checked instance detail could find eb snapshot created lvm volume mountpoint backup know per privacy security concern aws premium support engineer visibility running application file exist inside ec2 instance customer however tried help based best effort shared link could help using try recover file filesystem marked deleted best practise would recommend create instance ami eb snapshot backup install work order tarck coming user activity consider work auditd service collect write log file audit disk background service,9,pleasure premium inconvenience underlying feel contacting hope happy conversation chatting corner incoming reviewed star rated experience ahead rating assisting talking

To summarize our conversation, you reached out to us as ?hostname"" command was giving the IP instead of the static hostname which was set inside the instance i-05ac93838148c4c25.

Following the call session, I'm sending you the recap of our conversation.  You reached us because you observed DB fail-over due to network issue and would like to find out the root cause of the issue. Also From the latest correspondence, I see the instance system event logs is reporting the following records:  ""The network interface ""Amazon Elastic Network Adapter"" has begun resetting.  There will be a momentary disruption in network connectivity while the hardware resets. Reason: The network driver detected that its hardware has stopped responding to commands. This network interface has reset 1 time(s) since it was last initialized.""  ""Amazon Elastic Network Adapter: Adapter reset has been started""  First of all, I do apologize for the inconvenience this must have caused to you.   ====> Troubleshooting analysis I carefully checked the DB instance ID's ""i-080e0a0bbee9e76b3 and i-0f3978f645fb3ac66"" which are deployed in ""ap-southeast-2"" as instance type ""r5a.large"" and Microsoft Windows Server 2019. Going one step further, I confirmed the instances are experiencing 2/2 health status checks passed, which means both underlying hardware [1, 2] and OS are reporting healthy status.  As we confirmed no issues happened in the underlying hardware, therefore I am suspecting something on the OS side caused the reset on network adapters, causing DB to fail-over. Please note that this can be caused due to several factors, such as:  - High network utilization.  - Primary SQL utilization, plus backup running.  - Antivirus  - Network drivers  Digging further, I checked the instance ID ""i-080e0a0bbee9e76b3"" which reported the DB fail-over issue recently experienced a high traffic in the network utilization [3, 4], whereas the instance ID ""i-0f3978f645fb3ac66"" which is working fine did not experienced network spikes [5, 6] .

9967,8373063711,RBL Bank Limited,Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2 - Linux),APAC,INDIA,rakshc,"Hi Shruti,  Thank you for your valuable time on call and screenshare today. Please find a brief summary of our discussion below:  You reached out to us as you wanted to replace current ext4 filesystem with LVM+XFS filesystem. We ran the below commands to do the same:  # fdisk /dev/xvdb  we deleted the three partitions present on this /dev/xvdb device by pressing d option. Then we re-created partitions with LVM type by pressing n and t options.  After recreating the partitions SSH service did not come as /var/empty directory was deleted. So, we created /var/empty directory temporarily on the root filesystem by running below commands:  mkdir /var/empty cd /var/empty mkdir sshd mkdir sshd/etc cd /var/empty/sshd/etc ln -s /etc/localtime localtime  We also added these commands to /etc/rc.local file. We also modified /etc/fstab file and commented entries for /tmp, /var, /var/log. Then we rebooted the instance so that kernel takes new partition table.

This is Francisco again, and I would like to thank you for your time on the phone today. I am here to provide a recap of our conversation alongside my findings and next steps.  After reviewing the logs for instance i-0ef724ab7fc1b2e69, I have found that the instance have had a series of ENA reset events 5007 which is caused when the OS doesn't receive a keep alive signal from the ENA in time.  This may happen in different workloads, but we have observed SQL clustering workloads are more prone to present this behavior. This way, I would like to propose the following action plan:  === INVESTIGATION ===  In the OS logs, I have verified the following:  i-0ef724ab7fc1b2e69 -  ENA Driver version: 2.2.2  Event logs show (and not limited to the entries below) evidence indicating the OS sent a ENA reset, which in servers may interpret as malfunction.  For the Windows Error Reporting I couldn't find any additional issues.  === NEXT STEPS ===   1. Update the ENA driver on instance - As we discussed, this is a very important step as version 2.2.3 fixes an issue with false-positive HW unresponsiveness:   {+} https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/WindowsGuide/enhanced-networking-ena.html#ena-adapter-driver-versions     2. Set the ENA to increase the Receive buffers, and also to prevent RSS from running on CPU 0 - We have identified that instances can present this behavior depending on the workload, causing the OS to log ENA resets and ena events 5205, and 5007.     Due to that, we recommend setting the ENA as we described in our documentation, which you can do in a maintenance window for your server:   {+} https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/WindowsGuide/aws-sql-clustering.html#sql-clustering-ena  Please verify the information above, and apply the recommendation above, which is intended to solve the issue you are experiencing with the instance.

You have contacted us that, after performing the package upgrade via the yum command, the instance not booting normal and failing the instance status check, there were around 8 machines had same issue which are launched from same base AMI.  To begin with, we have checked the console logs for the instance and noticed that instance entered into the emergency mode and reported failed to find the root and swap device. So, we have attached the volume to recovery instance and reverted the kernel to previous working kernel and booted the instance, however, the instance was failing with same error.  - https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/revert-stable-kernel-ec2-reboot/  Since the instance [i-071dee28150a78d15] was new and no application configured, you have replaced the root volume from working instance and we had performed the yum update again. Then, we confirmed the new initramfs (initramfs-4.18.0-305.el8.x86_64.img) was created and included the nvme and ena drivers.

You wished ot understand whether it was possible to run IIS on a Linux EC2 instance. Unfortunately, this is not possible: IIS is only supported on the Windows operating system.  Depending on your use case, there are alternatives available. As discussed on our call, Apache is not suitable. However, if your needs involve running .NET applications, then it is possible to run .NET core applications on Linux, for example with nginx, as described in Microsoft's article below:  ## Host ASP.NET Core on Linux with Nginx [+] https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/host-and-deploy/linux-nginx?view=aspnetcore-5.0  Alternatively, if your needs involve running a reverse proxy as you mentioned may be the case, then nginx is more than capable of doing that.

I'm sorry about the inconvenience of your sudden instance outage. Taking a look at the underlying hardware, I notice that there was a hardware inadvertent failure at 2021-05-23 18:05 UTC, causing the stopping of your instance at 2021-05-23 18:06:06 UTC (2021-05-23 23:36 IST), which is around the time you provided.  As you know, hardware equipment will never enjoy 100% up time, and from time to time there are system failures. We make every commercially available effort to make sure Amazon Web Services is secure and resilient, giving you reliability and massive scale. However, hardware and network failures will inevitably occur in any environment.  To avoid prolonged downtime for an instance in future in case of a underlying host issue, I would highly recommend setting up Auto Recovery for your instances, which allows AWS to automatically perform a stop/start when an underlying hardware failure occurs. You can find more information in our documentation at [1] and [2], and the steps on how this can be achieved.  On behalf of AWS, again I sincerely apologize for the inconvenience this issue has caused you. I hope the above information is useful for you.

As discussed, this email is to provide a summary as well as a place for continued discussion on this case.  You opened chat today because you received an AWS Abuse report that provided that your instance i-0a558e442272dfda0 had been the subject of unknown SMTP connectivity:  ?

Unfortunately, the EC2 instance has since been terminated, making the recovery process and further analysis challenging. You also reported that VPC Flow logs hadn't been enabled prior to this incident, so review was not possible from that perspective.  Because my access to security tools is limited, I opened an internal request with our security response team to investigate this issue to determine if there were any further logs that we could retrieve in this case.  We decided to end our chat while our investigation continued offline as the process to retrieve any available logs is time consuming.  As provided on chat, the chances of retrieving further information from an instance that has been terminated and VPC Flow logs not enabled is low. These logs are generally seen as outside of our Shared Responsibility model [1] where the security in the cloud is the customers responsibility. Despite this, we're happy to assist in any way we can to the best of our ability.  At this point, we're waiting on our internal EC2 services teams to provide whether or not we are able to retrieve logs from the ENI of this instance.  In the meantime, we have the following suggestions to make and questions to ask:  A - Passwords:  1) Determine the usernames and passwords for the instance.

My name is Rakesh and I am happy to assist you with this case today.  From the case description, I understand that, You would like to know if you can allow outbound traffic from security group attached to EC2 instance to specific FQDN's. Please let me know if I have misinterpreted.  A security group acts as a virtual firewall for your instance to control inbound and outbound traffic. On EC2 instances, Security groups are attached to the Elastic Network interfaces(ENIs).  The source/destination in case of Security group inbound/outbound rule respectively can be either of the below > security group,  > an IPv4 or IPv6 CIDR block,  > a single IPv4 or IPv6 address, or a  > prefix list ID.   It does not accept FQDN. Please refer [1] for the public document statement of the same.  We completely understand your requirement, but we regret that the feature is currently not available. I would certainly consider this scenario and raise a feature request internally, but I will be not be able to provide an ETA for the same. Please be assured that out internal team continuously works on making the user experience better and this is only possible by the feedbacks provided by our customer.

Please find below a brief summary of same:  Ask: ========= Need to understand if sysprep can pull software licenses off OS .   Discussion on call and chat: ===========================  1. I explained to you that Sysprep removes PC-specific information from the Windows image, including the PC?s security identifier (SID). This allows you to capture the image and apply it to other PCs. This is known as generalizing the PC.The Sysprep /generalize command removes unique information from a Windows installation so that you can reuse that image on different computers. It also uninstalls PC-specific drivers from the Windows image. 2. The Sysprep tool runs only if the PC is a member of a workgroup, not a domain. If the PC is joined to a domain, Sysprep removes the PC from the domain.  3.   I have never heard off sysprep taking off license from software but it essentially depends on how license binds itself to OS or hardware . It can only be known to developer of applications as to how they have coded license to attach .   4. You explained to me that you want to have a golden image that can be redeployed on multiple instances with software installed and domain joined as they deploy . I explained to you that best way to achieve that is to use the answer file with sysprep or use DISM command to inject software to image.   There are many ways to customize an image before deployment , its automation is the tricky part . Every environment has its own requirements and hence custom tailored solutions.  For example , a lot of customers use SCCM /MDT to create a customized golden image that can be run with sysprep +answer file while deployment .

It was a pleasure chatting with you. I am sharing a brief summary of our discussion on the chat.  You reached out to us because you were having issues while accessing the instance using SSM session manager.   During the chat we discussed that in order for the instance to be accessible using the session manager, below conditions should be met. [1]   1- SSM agent should be installed. 2- IAM role attached to the instance should allow SSM access. 3- Instance should be able to connect to the SSM endpoint over port 443.  I checked and found that all conditions were being satisfied. The IAM role attached to the instance did have the required permissions. While on the chat, you confirmed that issue has been resolved after waiting for few minutes.   Since the issue was resolved and as agreed over the chat, I will be marking this case as resolved.

You have contacted us that, as you observed the scheduled event for the instance ID ""i-0b525f5106eebb334"" and need to get more clarity on the events.  Using the internal tools and I confirmed that instance was scheduled for the retirement due to underlying host degradation and it was advised you to stop/start the instance before the retirement date  2021-06-17 12:00:00 UTC, so that, the instance will be migrated to new healthy host. Further, I recommended you to perform the stop/start of the instance immediately as possible as your instance was running on the degraded host and underlying host may go unresponsive before the scheduled maintenance.

It was a pleasure to chat with you today, below is a recap of our conversation.  You reached out to AWS Premium Support as you could not SSH into your instance and you observed an increase in CPUUtilization and IOPS.  I checked instance from my side and I could see spike on the CPUUtilization[1] as well as root volume hitting throughput limit of 128Mb/s. You root volume size is 50Gib which means it has a throughput limit of 128 MiB/s[2].   Further, you were pushing IOPS[3] above the baseline provided by your root volume. Baseline for your root volume is 150 IOPS and you were pushing above 600 IOPS, causing burst balance[4] to drop. The same pattern I can see on 3rd and 4th of June.  As mentioned on the chat, further investigation is required from OS level to find out which process is causing the high CPU and pushing the IOPS to the EBS volume. You mentioned that you have monitoring tools installed on the instance and the issue seems to be with wordpress and you are checking further on the application side.  You already upgraded instance type from c5 to r5a which provides more memory. If you would like to get a higher IOPS baseline, you can also increase your EBS volume. You can see all volumes types and their characteristics from [5].  I checked further, for any issues with underlying hardware and EBS volume and there is no issue.  I have also checked CPUUtilization for the last month and I could see there are spikes reaching around 85%, however, regarding the IOPS, it started increase from 1th of June.  I hope you will find this information useful at your end, please do let me know if you have any further queries or concerns. I will be more than happy to assist.

You needed some assistance with details on the RCA of why a number of your instances were rebooted.  During our call, I've informed you that this was due to a maintenance window (mw-0b3f3f7816280c48a) configured to run on a weekly basis as per the following cron expression, set when it was created on 2021-01-13 at 20:10:00 UTC:  cron(30 16 ? * FRI *)  The maintenance window has been set to run the AWS-RunPatchBaseline task on a number of instances in it's target group. This is why the instances were rebooted and we navigated to the maintenance window and task details during our call where these details can be seen.  We also briefly discussed CloudTrail logs. By default, CloudTrail provides data events of up to 90 days. For details further than that, you will have to make use of custom CloudTrails that you configure within the service. More information on this can be found here [1].  As requested, I have left this case open but you are welcome to close it if there is no further assistance required.  Alternatively, I will gladly assist if you have any further questions.  ========= References:  [1] Creating a trail for your AWS account: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awscloudtrail/latest/userguide/cloudtrail-create-and-update-a-trail.html  We value your feedback.

Please find a brief summary of our discussion  below:  You reached out to us as you are unable to launch instances using IAM role: tis-l3-role and are getting Unauthorized error. I informed you that to troubleshoot the issue we need to decode the error message and for that we need aws-cli: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/sts/decode-authorization-message.html and https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/aws-backup-encoded-authorization-failure/ .   I also informed you that SCP is enabled for your organization which may be causing the issue. Hence, I requested you to login to your account: 307455894664 using your IAM user and disable the SCP. You were facing some issue while logging in using IAM users and mentioned that you will check this with your team.  I also created a test IAM user in my test account with exact same IAM policies as  tis-l3-role and was able to launch an instance in my account successfully. Hence, I suspect that the issue can be with SCP only. Please try to launch an instance after disabling SCP one and please feel free to re-initiate if you continue to face the issue: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/organizations/latest/userguide/orgs_manage_policies_enable-disable.html  I hope the above information helps.

To summarize the conversation, you reached out today for assistance with instance i-03f4a1bdd1dc3c945 as instance reachability status checks were failing.  Looking at the EC2 instance underlying hardware I can confirm that the underlying hardware reported as healthy. [1]  Instance status checks monitor the software and network configuration of your individual instance. Amazon EC2 checks the health of the instance by sending an address resolution protocol (ARP) request to the network interface (NIC). These checks detect problems that require customer involvement to repair. [2]  To note, our Scope of Support [3] and our Shared Responsibility Model [4] documents outline - troubleshooting issues at the OS layer is out of scope for AWS Premium Support, and any troubleshooting provided would be on a best-effort approach.  The following are examples of problems that can cause instance status checks to fail:     - Failed system status checks     - Incorrect networking or startup configuration     - Exhausted memory     - Corrupted file system     - Incompatible kernel  AWS values the security and privacy of our customers. Because of this, our visibility of OS level resources is very limited, therefore I offered a screen-share session to assist you in investigating the OS level of the EC2 instance.  While beginning the investigation over screen-share, we noticed that another user on your team (surabhi.yadav@ext.icicilombard.com) stopped the instance and detached the root volume and you decided to hold off on any action until you could verify with that user. After checking with this user, you mentioned that they were able to get the instance started back up with passing instance status checks.  As requested, I have provided the reference documentation for viewing CloudTrail events in the console.

10261,8469885261,Edelweiss Financial Services Ltd,Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2 - Windows),APAC,INDIA,doonyand,"Hi Suhas,  Thank you for reaching back to AWS Premium Support! My name is Daniel and I will be assisting you today. From reading over your case, I understand that as per VAPT, when TLS 1.0 that needs to be disabled and TSL 2.0 enabled, RDP to i-01b6d29c227798991 fails and you would like guidance on ensuring required VAPT precautions are taken into account.  To set expectations straight, please note that this request is to be performed at OS level is part of System Administration tasks which AWS Support does not provide support, I will however attempt to assist as a best effort basis [1]. When specific security layer for remote (RDP) connections is enabled and SSL security layer is used, the SSL method required for use is TLS 1.0 to authenticate to the RD Session host. If TLS is not supported, the connection fails [2]. While attempting to disable TSL 1.0 and enabling TLS 2.0, you can verify and attempt changing the security layer value to 0 as described below [3]: 1. Run Regedit as an Administrator. 2. Navigate to here: HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Terminal Server\WinStations\RDP-Tcp 3. Review the value for 'SecurityLayer.' If the value is '2', then the server may be requiring TLS for RDP authentication, but failing to do so, as TLS has been disabled. 4. Try and change the value to 0 and attempt connecting to the instance while TLS 2.0 is enabled and TLS 1.0 is disabled.

My name is Duane and I will be working with you on this case.  I understand you would like us to open SMTP port 25 on the instance i-00f293cbda61abc2e.  I had a look on the backend and can confirm port 25 is not being throttled for this instance or for any of your instances in the ap-south-1 Mumbai region.  You could use the netstat command to find all active and listening ports as long as there is a service listening on those ports, below is the netstat command in cmd:  netstat -ano  If you have port 25 configured on your security groups and firewall and there is a service listening on the port you could run the below PowerShell command as well:  tnc 172.27.70.231 -p 25  I hope you find the above information helpful, if you do have any further questions could you please clarify your issue in more detail, if the above answers your question you may resolve the case at your leisure.

I am John from AWS Premium Support and I will be assisting you today.  From the case details, I understand that your instance i-0673eeca2555335a7 has failed the system status checks and the instance status checks and you would like to know the reason for the same. Please feel free to correct me if I am mistaken.   I have reviewed your instance and I can see that the instance started failing the system status checks at 2021-06-20 18:10 UTC. Using my internal tools I can see that the underlying host on which the instance was present experienced an unexpected hardware failure which system health checks[1] also showing a failure. The underlying host has been isolated using our internal automation tools and removed from production. I can see that you have stopped the instance on 2021-06-20 18:52 UTC and started the instance at 2021-06-20 18:56 UTC. The instance was migrated to a healthy hardware during this stop-start and thus there is no further action required at your end.  Kindly accept my sincere apologies on behalf of AWS for inconvenience caused to your business due to the hardware failure. I want to assure you that we make every commercially available effort to make sure Amazon Web Services is secure and resilient to provide you high reliability and massive scale. There are some best practices that are suggested to avoid/minimize downtime due to a hardware failure. I would like to take this opportunity to inform you about them.

You contacted AWS Support as you were unable to release EIP's from your account with the error, and this was preventing you from provisioning a new Coudformation stack.   The Cloudformation Stack [arn:aws:cloudformation:us-west-2:982269451703:stack/VPCStack/dc880b50-7268-11ea-b38c-0633c0d6fb32] was preventing the provisioning of additional EIP's.   I then went ahead and increased the limit of EIP's form 5 ==> 10, and afterwards you went ahead and retried creating the stack.  From my internal tooling I can see that the creation of the CFN stack was successful. Thank you for allowing me to help you out with this today.

In order to remedy this you followed option 2 in [1] to use the EC2Launch GUI to initialize your instance after every boot.   Afterwards, a stop-start showed that your userdata was executing as expected. As discussed, you will wait for the nightly AMI to be created, then test with it in the morning to verify that the setting persists in your new AMI. If you face any further difficulties, please reply here including the test instance launched from the new AMI, and the userdata log located at C:\ProgramData\Amazon\EC2-Windows\Launch\Log\UserdataExecution.log.  During our screenshare, we also found that your configuration instance was set to GMT instead of IST. You can also fix this in userdata using tzutil by adding this line to your script:  tzutil /s ""India Standard Time""  Thank you for your time and patience with this matter.

Thank you for contacting AWS Premium Support, I hope you are doing well, myself Saneesh from EC2 Linux team and I will be happy to help you with this case.  From the case description, I understand that, You received an email on 12:28AM IST about your EC2 persistent instance retirement scheduled, But the instance got rebooted before the scheduled date mentioned in the email. Please correct me if I misunderstood your query.  To investigate this issue, I have went ahead and looked at your instance 'i-05838a351448cacae', I can see that currently this instance is running on a healthy hardware and passing both instance and system level health checks. However, when I look at the metrics for last 24 hours, I could see that your instance was showing 'System status checks' [1] failure from 18:45 UTC to 21:04 UTC on 18-Jul-2021.  As you might be aware that 'System status checks' monitor the AWS systems on which your instance runs [2]. These checks detect underlying problems with your instance that require AWS involvement to repair. When a system status check fails, you can choose to wait for AWS to fix the issue, or you can resolve it yourself. For instances backed by Amazon EBS, you can stop and start the instance yourself, which in most cases results in the instance being migrated to a new host.  The following are examples of problems that can cause system status checks to fail:      Loss of network connectivity     Loss of system power     Software issues on the physical host     Hardware issues on the physical host that impact network reachability  On order to find the cause of the instance reboot, I have looked at the CloudTrial logs for your instance 'i-05838a351448cacae', I can see that the instance stop start has performed by the IAM user 'shraddhesh.rao', I am adding the details below, also you can find this link [3] to get more details about this stop-start event.

This is Sushil and was assisting you over the chat.  You reached out to us regarding ""SSH was not working on the instance "". It was my pleasure to assist you on this and please find the summary of our conversation.   While being on chat , we checked below things .   telnet 10.10.128.12 22 Trying 10.10.128.12... Connected to ip-10-10-128-12.ec2.internal. Escape character is '^]'.  Telnet was working for 1 time and other time was not working. Then SSH worked and stopped working again. We tried to find the route which request is coming as well via VPN if any route changes.  traceroute and mtr also did not help much on this. We checked the other working instance which has similar settings in route tables and no issues.  Later it was fixed automatically without intervention and you were able to telnet and SSH for multiple session.   I hope above information was helpful and able to address your concern. I can confirm that there was no issue at instance level which we checked via running top command. Please do reach out to AWS VPN team if you see the similar issue again.

It was nice working with you. I am following up regarding our discussion earlier.  To summarize, you had an instance i-09ec632a6120702cd failing reachability checks. I had a look at the instance.   I can see that the system status checks are healthy which means that the underlying hardware where your instance is running is healthy. Only the instance status checks are failing which is an indication of a problem inside the instance at the OS layer. Please note that we do not have visibility inside the instance for security and confidentiality reasons. Some typical reasons for instance status checks failures are resource exhaustion, broken network or startup configuration, kernel issues, or filesystem/device problems. For more information about EC2 status checks, please refer to this link [1].  To look at the system status checks metric, please refer to this link [2]. To look at the instance status checks metric, please refer to this link [3].  I checked the instance history and I can see it was launched about 2 hours ago. The instance never passed any status checks since it was launched. This means that the problem is in the AMI itself. You would need to fix those problems in the AMI first and then launch an instance from it. However, you mentioned that the instance that this AMI was created from was also already terminated. You mentioned you would be trying to launch another instance from a public Amazon Linux 2 AMI instead. If you need any data from this instance, you can simply attach the root volume to your new instance and copy the data over.  As discussed, I am going to mark this case as resolved. However, please feel free to reach out again in case of any other questions or concerns.

I am sending this email as a recap of our conversation.  You contacted us today because you were previously unable to connect to your instance i-0d8274b79c62e1e27 using the existing PEM key. Now you would like to launch a new instance using a backup AMI of this instance so that you can assign a new PEM key to this instance.  You also specified on chat that you want your new instance launched from the backup AMI of your instance to have the same primary private IP address as it.  To ensure that your new instance can be configured to use the IP address 10.26.1.119, it is first required that this IP address must not be tied to any other AWS resource, in this case meaning that you will have to terminate your instance i-0d8274b79c62e1e27 and ensure its ENI eni-0d56afccb9c335a86 using the IP address has been terminated also.   How do I assign a custom primary private IP address to my Amazon EC2 instance?  https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/custom-private-primary-address-ec2/  Before taking any further action here, I advise you to create an AMI [1] of your instance to have as a backup.  Once you have clarified that you have an up-to-date backup of your instance available, terminate your EC2 instance i-0d8274b79c62e1e27 [2].   The termination of your instance will also delete the ENI eni-0d56afccb9c335a86, making the IP address 10.26.1.119 available in your private IP address pool for your subnet subnet-788da00e.  Now that the private IP address 10.26.1.119 is available in your address pool, you can launch a new EC2 instance by following steps available in the below documentation.   Launch an instance using the Launch Instance Wizard  https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/WindowsGuide/launching-instance.html   Ensure that on the 'Choose an Amazon Machine Image (AMI)' page that you are selecting your custom AMI, and that on the 'Configure Instance' page you configure your new instance to be in the same ",7/8/2021 0:00,7/18/2021 0:00,RE:[CASE 8561010931] Need to create a new PEM key and attach to a windows instance,4,"10.26.1.119,https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/custom-private-primary-address-ec2/,10.26.1.119,10.26.1.119,https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/WindowsGuide/launching-instance.html",hello mathi thanks time chat today wa pleasure working today sending email recap conversation contacted today previously unable connect instance using existing pem key would like launch new instance using backup ami instance assign new pem key instance also specified chat want new instance launched backup ami instance primary private address ensure new instance configured use address first required address must tied aws resource case meaning terminate instance ensure using address ha terminated also assign custom primary private address amazon ec2 instance taking action advise create ami instance backup clarified backup instance available terminate ec2 instance termination instance also delete making address available private address pool subnet private address available address pool launch new ec2 instance following step available documentation launch instance using launch instance wizard ensure choose amazon machine image ami page selecting custom ami configure instance page configure new instance,9,pleasure premium inconvenience underlying feel contacting hope happy conversation chatting corner incoming reviewed star rated experience ahead rating assisting talking

You reached out today, as you do not have the .pem key file used to encrypt the administrator password for the EC2 instance i-0acee79480715274b and you requested assistance in this regard.   Whenever the key pair used to launch a Windows instance is lost, the key pair needs to be replaced. To do this, there are two options, namely using SSM or performing the steps manually as illustrated in the article below:  [+] https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/ec2-windows-replace-lost-key-pair/  I have looked at i-0acee79480715274b and see that is a managed instance in the SSM console. So if you were to manually go through the process, this is how I would do it:  1. Connect to i-0acee79480715274b using a SSM Session Manager session from the console [1]. 2. Reset the local administrator password by running this command:  net user administrator <newAdminPassword> 3. RDP to i-0acee79480715274b using the administrator username with the new password specified in Step 2 4. Once connected, you can configure the Administrator password to be regenerated and encrypted by EC2Config [2]:  a) Open the XML file at the file path - \Program Files\Amazon\Ec2ConfigService\Settings\config.xml  b) At the top of the file, find the plugin with the name Ec2SetPassword and change the state from Disabled to Enabled and save the file. 5. Stop the instance and create an image of it [3]. 6. Once the AMI is available, launch an instance from the AMI created in Step 5. For Select a key pair, choose a key pair you do have access to. 7. Once this new instance is up and running, you can disassociate 13.229.187.44 from i-0acee79480715274b [4] and associate it to the instance launched from Step 6 [5].  You now have replaced the lost .pem file with one you do have and you should be able to retrieve the local Administrator's password from the EC2 console and connect to the instance.

10571,8574435521,HDFC Life Insurance Company Limited,Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2 - Linux),APAC,INDIA,jailosip,"Good day  Thank you for contacting AWS premium support, Its Jailosi again here. We got disconnected from the chat.  You reached out in order to find out why your instance was restarted.  During the investigation, We discovered that the instance was restarted through an API call. below are the API call event details.  eventId: 07cadcc0-463d-4dea-a560-7b3a9ed09e10 12:23:42 PM eventName: StopInstances 12:23:42 PM username: WIP_COR400@hdfcsldm.com 12:23:42 PM eventTime: 2021-07-11T19:30:25 UTC 12:23:42 PM  After reviewing this information, you wanted to know why the instance was started and if there was a problem on AWS side.  I mentioned that we would not know the reasons behind a reboot of an instance, however, I could check on my side to see if there was any problem with the underlying hardware during the time you specified  I looked into the system status check of the previous hardware and found that there were failed system checks on the hardware during the same period the instance was restarted. Perhaps this event influenced the restart of the instance as we have observed.

Instance i-0b249e99c8b68b281 was unable to boot due to file system failures on the root volume vol-0d412d164102c1bb7 and the LVM volume vol-0517fdeffba0ac3f5.   We proceed to shutdown the failed instance, then attached the root volume vol-0d412d164102c1bb7  to a rescue instance you spun up. We perform a e2fsck file check on the root volume which was successful.  We then proceeded to mount the root volume back to the failed instance. However we were still unable to boot.    I noticed in the console logs that that its was failing to load the LVM volume vol-0517fdeffba0ac3f5 as well. We proceeded to mount the LVM volume onto the rescue instance and ran through e2fsck on each of the LVM mappings for the volume. We then attached the volume back to the failed instance however the instance was still failing to boot.  We then proceeded to launch a new rescue instance based of Amazon Linux1 in order to further check the grub configuration for the instance. We noticed that selinux is not enabled however in the /boot/grub/grub.conf that the option that selinux was set to 1 which means enabled. We then edited the grub.conf to selinux=0, in order to disable the use of selinux. We then unmounted the failed root volume back onto the original instance.   We then started the failed instance again and could confirm that the instance was passing status checks and you could access the instance via SSH.  As per our conversation , I will mark this case as resolved on my end. Pleasure assisting you once again Abhishek.  We value your feedback.

My name is Romesh & I will be assisting you with case today. From case description I can understand that you would like to know about how to keep Ec2 instances sync with time and how timesync is managed at Ec2 level. Kindly correct me if I misunderstood your query as there was not much information present in case.  I would like to give information about Amazon Time Sync Service which provides a highly accurate and reliable time reference that is natively accessible from Amazon EC2 instances.  Built on Amazon's proven network infrastructure, the service utilizes a fleet of redundant satellite-connected and atomic reference clocks in AWS regions to deliver current time readings of the Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) global standard. The service is designed to be highly available with a continuously monitored time infrastructure and provides a low variance reference time source. Leap seconds are known to cause application errors, and can be a concern for developers and system administrators. The Amazon Time Sync Service automatically smooths out (smears) leap seconds that are periodically added to UTC, so that customers do not have to worry about application errors due to their addition. In the future, we will also provide mechanisms for accessing non-leap smeared time. EC2 instances running in Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) can access this service at a universally reachable IP address. .  https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2017/11/introducing-the-amazon-time-sync-service/  You can access the Amazon Time Sync Service service via the link local 169.254.169.123 IP address. This means you dont need to configure external internet access and the service can be securely accessed from within your private subnets.  You can follow below documentation to find more information about how to use amazon tiemsync service on ec2 .  https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/set-time.html  In case if you your query is not about Amazon Timesync service & ",7/13/2021 0:00,7/14/2021 0:00,RE:[CASE 8578408921] Chat: Regarding timesync on EC2 instance,4,"https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2017/11/introducing-the-amazon-time-sync-service/,169.254.169.123,https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/set-time.html",hello team thanks contacting aws premium support name romesh assisting case today case description understand would like know keep ec2 instance sync time timesync managed ec2 level kindly correct misunderstood query wa much information present case would like give information amazon time sync service provides highly accurate reliable time reference natively accessible amazon ec2 instance built amazon proven network infrastructure service utilizes fleet redundant satellite connected atomic reference clock aws region deliver current time reading coordinated universal time global standard service designed highly available continuously monitored time infrastructure provides low variance reference time source leap second known cause application error concern developer system administrator amazon time sync service automatically smooth smear leap second periodically added customer worry application error due addition future also provide mechanism accessing non leap smeared time ec2 instance running amazon virtual private cloud vpc access service universally reachable address access amazon time sync service service via link local address mean dont need configure external internet access service securely accessed within private subnets follow documentation find information use amazon tiemsync service ec2 case query amazon timesync service,9,pleasure premium inconvenience underlying feel contacting hope happy conversation chatting corner incoming reviewed star rated experience ahead rating assisting talking

It was a pleasure speaking with you today.  I would just like to recap our discussion regarding your performance difference in your load testing from your Logstash i-011231f80b92e3e75  & i-0bd29c55d070d104d instances running in the us-east-1a region.

The instance types, AMI, and configuration are identical  aside from the 50GB root partition difference in your EBS gp3 volume.   During our call, you also confirmed that you have a RAID setup on your ephemeral devices that the application is using. We confirmed that via iostat that drive utilization was not impending operations on either cluster as utilization ranged between 20-30%.  We could also see from monitoring the resouces via htop that the problematic servers were not being heavily utilized.  The CPU utilization between these two clusters showed differences as the good cluster was able to take more CPU load and showed more elevated CPU activity. We could see this on our CloudWatch CPUUtilization metrics referenced below [1][2]. We then focused on network utilization to see if there wereany bottlenecks impacting your Kibana request rate and request time metrics observed. We could see that the network utilization was higher on the good performing cluster [3][4].

10638,8589764001,Juspay Technologies Pvt Ltd,Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2 - Linux),APAC,INDIA,jdavismk,"Hello Saumitra,  Thank you for your time on chat earlier. It was a pleasure speaking with you. I'm following up with a short summary of our discussion.  As you confirmed, the termination of instances was due to a intentional and manual decrease in the desired number of instances for that AutoScaling group. This decrease was issued due to an unexpected and unexplained scaling event, and you wish to know what caused the scaling event.  I reviewed the AutoScaling group and found that there was an scaling policy attached to it, set to trigger a scale-out of 10 instances whenever the OutboundProxyActiveFlowCount CloudWatch alarm was triggered. This alarm triggered whenever ActiveFlowCount rose above a certain amount, however there was no corresponding scale-in event. This meant that every time the alarm triggered, the AutoScaling group would scale-out by another 10 instances, again and again until the maximum 80 instances was reached.   From the AutoScaling group side, only 6 instances were terminated due to failing health checks; the same 6 mentioned by my colleague. I reviewed the UnhealthyHostCount metric as requested, and saw that although there were several occasions during which there were unhealthy hosts, these were preceded by scale-out events which helped to handle the increased loads, leading to the instances apparently returning to a healthy state.  I hope this helped to clear matters up, but if you have any additional questions, please don't hesitate to update the case and I will be happy to help.  We value your feedback.

To recap our conversation you reached out to us because the EC2 instance 'i-05a0fe5794df73345' was failing instance status checks.  We reviewed the instance and noticed it was failing to mount some mount points in '/efc/fstab'. We detached the root volume and attached it to a rescue instance. We commented out the entry for EFS and re-attached the volume to the affected instance.  We were able to successfully start and access the instance. We then tried to mount the EFS filesystem again but we were still getting an error. Upon mounting the EFS file system using the mount command, it was mounted successfully.  We reviewed the fstab entry and noticed the entry was as below   $ fs-1b1653ca:/ /efs efs defaults, _netdev 0 0   We updated the entry to the following and upon mounting it worked.   $ $ fs-1b1653ca:/ /efs efs defaults,_netdev 0 0   We also tested this by rebooting the instance and confirmed it worked.   As agreed on chat, I will mark this case as resolved since no further action is required from our end.  I hope you find this summary of the case helpful.

10680,8603888111,PayU Payments Private Limited,Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2 - Linux),APAC,INDIA,jkkevan,"Hello,  It was a pleasure working with you today. I wanted to take this time to summarize out chat today.  When we connected you let me know that you had expanded your EBS volume but it was slow in updating the new size. By the time we connected on chat it was complete, but you were still seeing ""Out of Space on Disk"" errors from your application. I asked for the output of df -h and we could see that the OS was seeing the additional space, and that the volume was only at around 50% utilization:  Filesystem              Size  Used Avail Use% Mounted on /dev/nvme0n1p1 118G 55G   59G  49%        /  From this we can summarize that the issue is likely with the application. You had mentioned that you believed the issue to be hardware, but I have looked into the hardware of both the instance and the attached EBS volume and both are reporting as healthy. I did let you know that you could stop/start (not reboot) the instance and it would be moved to new hardware, but you said you had already done that.   You then let me know that you were ok for now, but would update the case if you ran into any other issues.

10698,8611438281,PayU Payments Private Limited,Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2 - Linux),APAC,INDIA,ajthmps,"Hi team,  Thanks for your time in the meeting earlier. You got in touch as you were no longer able to SSH into your EC2 instance ""i-02ae29e6ce4d0c53d"" as it was returning the error ""Connection Refused"".  This error typically suggests that SSH is not running. After reviewing the instance's console log[1], I was able to determine that the SSH service was indeed failing to start:    Starting OpenSSH server daemon...   [FAILED] Failed to start OpenSSH server daemon.   See 'systemctl status sshd.service' for details.  Using an Amazon Linux recovery instance, we re-mounted the problem instance's root EBS volume (vol-0ed83e4328c1380dc) to it and then mounted it:    $ lsblk   $ sudo mount /dev/xvdf1 /mnt  We then invoked chroot to /mnt using:    $ sudo mount -t sysfs /sys /mnt/sys   $ sudo mount -t proc /proc /mnt/proc   $ sudo mount -o bind /dev /mnt/dev   $ sudo chroot /mnt  At this point we were able to natively run commands on the problem root disk. We started off by checking the sshd config using:    $ sshd -t  This returned multiple errors relating to permissions under /etc/ssh/. After further investigation we found that the root file system permissions had been globally changed to ""755"". For example, using the command ""chmod -R 755 /"" which is not ideal at all.  We initially ran the following commands to manually fix permissions:    $ chmod 644 /etc/ssh/ssh_config   $ chmod 600 /etc/ssh/sshd_config   $ chmod 640 /etc/ssh/ssh_host_ecdsa_key   $ chmod 644 /etc/ssh/ssh_host_ecdsa_key.pub   $ chmod 640 /etc/ssh/ssh_host_ed25519_key   $ chmod 644 /etc/ssh/ssh_host_ed25519_key.pub   $ chmod 640 /etc/ssh/ssh_host_rsa_key   $ chmod 644 /etc/ssh/ssh_host_rsa_key.pub  However, we also needed to fix sudo permissions. We used the following command to fix all sudo permissions:    $ rpm --setugids sudo && rpm --setperms sudo  At this point you were able to re-attach the EBS volume back to the original instance, SSH in and execute sudo commands.

10704,8618380941,ICICI LOMBARD GENERAL INSURANCE COMPANY LIMITED,Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2 - Linux),APAC,INDIA,denakul,"Hello Meghraj,  Thank you for your time on call and chat. It was pleasure talking to you.  Here is the summary of the discussion that we had:   - You had the query about maximum number of EBS volumes that can be attached to ""r5.24xlarge"" instance type.   - As mentioned over the call, ""r5.24xlarge"" instance type is a nitro based instance which has a maximum limit of 28 attachments including everything like EBS volumes, Network cards etc. Please see our AWS document that mentions the same[1].  - Further, you have asked whether there is an option to increase this limit. Unfortunately the maximum attachment limit for the Nitro system is a physical limitation dictated by the hardware itself, so it is not possible to increase this limit. EBS Volumes attach directly to the Instance through specialized NVMe Nitro Cards, bypassing the hypervisor itself and so there is a physical limitation in this regard. So we do not have an option to alter this limit in anyway.   Customer feedback is the main driver behind all of our service enhancements, so we really appreciate you reaching out to us with your feedback. I apologize for any inconvenience this may cause and hope that I have answered all your queries.  Now, as concluded, currently, since there is nothing much that we could do here at the moment, and as all your queries are addressed, I am just marking this case as archived for now. But if you have got any queries/concerns, please feel free to get back to us by opening a new chat/case request and we will be more than happy to assist you in all possible ways.

10705,8619319691,HDFC Life Insurance Company Limited,Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2 - Linux),APAC,INDIA,eloisilv,"Hi Shammi,  It was a pleasure speaking with you today. I just wanted to send a short follow up summarizing what we spoke about.  You opened the chat because some of your instances was failing to resolve the domain name ""dws-pp.hdfclife.com"".  Therefore, since the issue is intermittent, I suspected of VPC DNS throttling, which you can confirm by following the article below:  - https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/vpc-find-cause-of-failed-dns-queries/   Moreover, in case you confirm VPC DNS throttling, I suggested you to use a DNS cache, which usually avoid DNS resolution failures. Nonetheless, when you use a DNS cache to query external DNS resources, the cache answers most of the recurring DNS queries locally without interacting with the DNS resolver over the network. For more information regarding DNS cache, please refer to the documentation below:  - https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/dns-resolution-failures-ec2-linux/   However, you mentioned that you also faced DNS issues to resolve your domain on Ubuntu instances, which is using systemd-resolve as DNS cache. Thus, in order to try to trigger the issue, I shared a loop command to query 10000 times the cache DNS and VPC DNS, however, we were not able to trigger the issue, and all queries run successfully.      for i in $(seq 10000);do dig @127.0.0.53 dws.hdfclife.com |grep -i ""fail|nxdomain"" ;done     for i in $(seq 10000);do dig @172.27.96.2 dws.hdfclife.com |grep -i ""fail|nxdomain"" ;done   Finally, we then disabled systemd-resolve from one of your Ubuntu instance (test instance), and you will monitor your application to see if the issue persist or not. In case you don't face the issue on the test instance, I suggest you to either disable systemd-resolve from the instances that you still face the issue, or use DNSMasq [01] as DNS cache.      rm /etc/resolv.conf     cp /run/systemd/resolve/resolv.conf /etc/resolv.conf     systemctl disable systemd-resolved.service     systemctl stop systemd-resolved.service     echo ""option",7/22/2021 0:00,7/22/2021 0:00,RE:[CASE 8619319691] Chat: ec2 issue,4,"dws-pp.hdfclife.com,https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/vpc-find-cause-of-failed-dns-queries/,https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/dns-resolution-failures-ec2-linux/,@127.0.0.53,dws.hdfclife.com,@172.27.96.2,dws.hdfclife.com",shammi wa pleasure speaking today wanted send short follow summarizing spoke opened chat instance wa failing resolve domain name therefore since issue intermittent suspected vpc dns throttling confirm following article moreover case confirm vpc dns throttling suggested use dns cache usually avoid dns resolution failure nonetheless use dns cache query external dns resource cache answer recurring dns query locally without interacting dns resolver network information regarding dns cache please refer documentation however mentioned also faced dns issue resolve domain ubuntu instance using systemd resolve dns cache thus order try trigger issue shared loop command query time cache dns vpc dns however able trigger issue query run successfully seq dig grep fail nxdomain done seq dig grep fail nxdomain done finally disabled systemd resolve one ubuntu instance test instance monitor application see issue persist case face issue test instance suggest either disable systemd resolve instance still face issue use dnsmasq dns cache systemctl disable systemd resolved service systemctl stop systemd resolved service echo option,9,pleasure premium inconvenience underlying feel contacting hope happy conversation chatting corner incoming reviewed star rated experience ahead rating assisting talking

10714,8620012141,Juspay Technologies Pvt Ltd,Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2 - Linux),APAC,INDIA,pavantan,"Hello Aditya Thank you for your time on the chat today. This mail is to summarize to our discussion.  You had reached us today as the instance i-0e93453f3d3980041 was stopping automatically by itself. You are looking for assistance on identifying the issue.  I began by checking the ""System""[1] and ""Instance""[2] status checks in cloudwatch and do not see any issues there. This indicates there are no EC2 AWS underlying systems level issues that could be causing this. I next checked Cloudtrail logs for any EC2 API call ""StopInstances"" which is used to bring down and stop EC2 instance. There were no such API calls issued.  From my internal tools I could see that the instance went into stopped state with the message 'Instance initiated shutdown'. Looking at this AWS API documentation[3], this message usually indicates the shutdown was initiated from inside the operating system.  Due to security, privacy and shared responsibility model, AWS Support doesn't have visibility or access to instance logs[4]. Appreciate your understanding here.  Having said that, I see that the instance is launched with a private customized AMI. As discussed in chat, i recommend to take a look at the operating system logs to garner further information to look into the reason for the shutdown. If the instance doesn't stay up long enough to go through the logs, the root volume can be attached to a rescue instance to collect the logs using the below steps.  1) Launch a new Amazon EC2 instance to be used as rescue in the same subnet. 2) Detach the Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS) root volume (/dev/xvda or /dev/sda1) from your impaired instance[5]. 3) Attach the EBS volume as a secondary device ( /dev/sdf) to the rescue instance[6]. 4) Connect to your rescue instance using SSH. 5) Create a mount point directory (/rescue) for the new volume attached to the rescue instance in step 3. $ sudo mkdir /rescue 6) Mount the volume at the directory you created in step 5.

10715,8620372081,Delhivery,Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2 - Linux),APAC,INDIA,srachir,"Hello Akash,  Thank you for your time on the chat today! It was a pleasure assisting you. You reached out to us as you noticed an error ""sudo: /etc/sudoers.d/90-cloud-init-users is owned by uid 1000, should be 0, sudo: /etc/sudoers.d/ssm-agent-users is owned by uid 1000, should be 0"" while running ""sudo su"". Below is our chat summary for reference:  The error ""sudo: /etc/sudoers.d/90-cloud-init-users is owned by uid 1000, should be 0"" occurs when the /usr/bin/sudo or /etc/sudoers file is owned by a non-root user. The /usr/bin/sudo and sudoers file must have root:root as the owner.   We tried to fix the error by running the user-data script in link[1], however we got the same error. So, we decided to manually change it. We stopped the instance, detached the root volume and attached the volume to a test instance as /dev/sdf. Below are the steps we followed:   $ sudo mount /dev/xvdf1 /mnt  $ cd /mnt  $ ls -al    Here we noticed that the permissions for /etc/ itself was changed to ec2-user:ec2-user.   $ sudo chmod -R root:root /mnt/etc   We ran the above command to fix the permissions.   $ sudo umount /mnt  Once we followed the above steps, we detached the volume and reattached it to the original instance as /dev/xvda and started the instance back up. After this you were successfully connected to the instance.   On this note, we ended our chat session. As discussed on the chat, I'll go ahead and resolve this case on your behalf. Please feel free to let me know if you have any other questions or concerns and I'll be glad to assist.

From the case description and during our call, I understood that SSM agent on instance ""i-05d4e471aa9d9b2b3"" doesn't start.  I investigated this issue and please find the recap of our troubleshooting as follows:  - Reviewed instance and instance is passing both its status checks [1]. - Checked security gateway, ACL and route table. No issue found from these settings. - We tried uninstall and reinstall the SSM agent manually [2]. - Upon checking SSM logs attached, I found the following error"" ""Failed to start agent. failed to get identity: failed to find agent identity"" This error is related identity issue and checked the metadata access by viewing following URL: http://169.254.169.254/latest/dynamic/instance-identity/document  I understand you cannot restart instance right now since its a production instance. I did some further research, Kindly stop the SSM agent from PowerShell by running the below command with elevated privileges:  Get-Process | processname -ssm-agent-worker | Stop-Process -Force; Restart-Service -Name AmazonSSMAgent   Once you stopped the ssm-agent-worker.exe process, could you attempt to start SSM agent service.

I am interested to know the results of the test. Also, are you able to confirm that the script always produces consistent results? In other words, does the script produce the same result every single time it is run?   As I mentioned previously, AWS support does not cover the troubleshooting and debugging of custom scripts. The 'cron' utility in Linux is only a scheduler; so if there is a discrepancy, it is likely in the task that was configured in 'cron'. I would like to suggest that you involve a Linux systems administrator here as well so that they may review your script and cron configuration.

10769,8631901681,Solutions Infini Technologies (India) Private Limited,Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2 - Linux),APAC,INDIA,shrmrp,"Hello Anu,  Thank you for your patience.  As per the update from the internal service team, there were no issues with the underlying host during the time the instance CPU spiked, so to summarize the issue seems to have been triggered at the OS level itself. Also, if we see the number of processes that were running that time, there are 900+ processes initiated by Apache, so there is a possibility of Apache user ulimit being hit which is a configuration at the OS level and since the instance is terminated we cannot check those limits. Since the issue at host end has been isolated, the investigation further would require an access to the OS logs such as /var/log/messages and /var/log/dmesg and unfortunately we do not have this data available. The graphs that you shared were helpful in reaching out on a conclusion that there was high load average including the memory unavailability on the instance at that time which points that the root cause seems to be some culprit process hogging the server resources or some limits being hit at the OS level. As discussed on the call, I would suggest you to have the ""ATOP"" tool configured on the OS for a better analysis of the server resources and the processes running on it.   For more details on the tool here:  https://www.tecmint.com/how-to-install-atop-to-monitor-logging-activity-of-linux-system-processes/  Unfortunately, we are unable to dive deep for further investigation due to lack of OS logs and instance being terminated as of now. I completely understand that this might not be the exact response that you were looking for and we are really sorry for the same, however in such scenarios when there is no issue at the host/hardware level, we cannot provide an RCA and in this case the situation is a little different as well considering the instance is no longer available.  I hope you understand our limitations here and in case you want to discuss anything, please feel free to update the case and we can schedule a call.  Have a great day ahead!  We value your feedback.

10779,8633111601,Edelweiss Financial Services Ltd,Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2 - Linux),APAC,INDIA,chittath,"Dear AWS customer,  Thank you for contacting the AWS Premium Support, my name is Abhilash and it was a pleasure talking to you today. Please find the brief summary of our conversation.  You contacted AWS support as you were getting the insufficient capacity error when launching the ""r5a.2xlarge"" instance type in ap-south-1a and ap-south-1b AZ .  As you might be aware, the Insufficient Capacity error means that the new instance was unable to launch due to the lack of unused r5a.2xlarge instance type in our pool in that specific AZ (ap-south-1a, 1b) at that time. The on-demand capacity is dynamic, may be different for different availability zones and different instance types and sizes and hence changes frequently and these changes cannot be predicted.   On behalf of AWS, I sincerely apologize about any inconvenience or business impact caused by this. I verified the capacity for in ap-south-1a, 1b AZ  when you faced the issues and confirmed that there was not enough capacity for r5a.2xlarge  instance type. I verified other AZ's in the ap-south-1 region and confirmed that, ap-south-1c had some capacity but you updated that you are not operating in that AZ.  However, I would like to bring to your attention that on-demand capacity is not guaranteed. The  ""Insufficient Capacity""  error will resolve itself as we add capacity or turn over currently running instances, but we cannot estimate how long this will take. Because, as customers keep on adding resources on the fly and we have no insight as to how many resources and how long the resources will be occupied by customers. Due to this the capacity may change. Apart from this our  EC2 Capacity team would automatically be aware of low capacity issue and always try to increase capacity based on the demand, but the work flow would take substantial amount of time to get more capacity in. Due to this I will not be able to provide an ETA.  [R1].

It was a pleasure to work with you today over chat. Kindly find the summary of our conversation below.  You reached out to us today because you wanted to increase the disk size beyond 2TB for the Ec2 instance i-079b9cd6447034f31 vol-05653661bb1c6763c. The EC2 instance has Ubuntu 18.04 OS. You had a 2TB volume which you modified to 3TB but you were unable to extend it because of the MBR error.   I informed you that the reason for this error is that MBR doesn't support more than 2TB and the resolution would be to convert the EC2 Ubuntu instance's default MBR partitioning scheme to GPT in order to bypass the 2 TiB limit for MBR partitions on the EBS volume. I provided you with the document that I have listed in the references as [1] which has the detailed steps that need to be followed in order to resolve the issue.   Since making changes at the OS level was a system admin task, I agreed to provided you support on best effort basis. You were concerned about step 8 in the above document. To protect your critical data, I suggested you to take a backup of the instance and the volume using Amazon EBS-backed Linux AMI [2].   You had a question regarding nvme0n1p1 which is 2 TB and if you can create nvme0n1p2. This wasnt possible because in order to use more than 2TB on nvme0n1 you would need to convert default MBR partitioning scheme to GPT.   Followed by which you had a question regarding shrinking the EBS volume size from 3TB to 2TB as only 2 TB was mounted. I verified this on my test instance and confirmed that it is not possible to reduce the size of the EBS volume as I got this error The size of a volume can only be increased, not decreased.  I suggested you a work around by adding another 1TB volume to the EC2 instance as a secondary volume. You wanted steps to mount an EBS volume as a secondary volume for which I provided you with the documents  Step 1: Create a new volume [3]  Step 2: Attach it to the EC2 instance [4]  Step 3: Make th",7/28/2021 0:00,7/28/2021 0:00,RE:[CASE 8641982531] Chat: Need to increase disk size beyond 2 TB,4,,hello sankalp greeting karthik aws premium support wa pleasure work today chat kindly find summary conversation reached today wanted increase disk size beyond ec2 instance ec2 instance ha ubuntu volume modified unable extend mbr error informed reason error mbr doe support resolution would convert ec2 ubuntu instance default mbr partitioning scheme gpt order bypass limit mbr partition eb volume provided document listed reference ha detailed step need followed order resolve issue since making change level wa system admin task agreed provided support best effort basis concerned step document protect critical data suggested take backup instance volume using amazon eb backed linux ami question regarding create wasnt possible order use would need convert default mbr partitioning scheme gpt followed question regarding shrinking eb volume size wa mounted verified test instance confirmed possible reduce size eb volume got error size volume increased decreased suggested work around adding another volume ec2 instance secondary volume wanted step mount eb volume secondary volume provided document step create new volume step attach ec2 instance step make,9,pleasure premium inconvenience underlying feel contacting hope happy conversation chatting corner incoming reviewed star rated experience ahead rating assisting talking

I wanted to summarize our conversation and provide you some resources.  You reached out to us for troubleshooting the instance status check failure for the instance (i-0269a0b0823d403b9).  An instance status check failure indicates a problem with the instance, such as [1]: - Networking or startup configuration issues - Exhausted memory - File system issues - Failure to boot the operating system - Failure to mount volumes correctly - Incompatible drivers  From the screenshot, I confirmed that instance was booted up and could see logon screen. If an instance becomes unreachable during logon [2], there could be a problem with your network configuration or Windows Remote Desktop Services. An instance can also be unresponsive if a process is using large amounts of CPU.  As a part of troubleshooting, we have done the following steps - Stop/start didn't fix the issue - Attached secondary ENI and soon after that, instance status checks were passing. - When login through domain credentials, you got ' There are currently no logon servers..' error. However, login through local 'Administrator' worked. - After RDP, we could see that primary ENI was disabled and we manually enabled it back. - After disabling the secondary ENI, we could see that primary ENI detected the domain 'airvistara.com' - However, user credentials for 'infrateam.tcs' didn't work for you. As discussed, please reset your domain credentials in the Active Directory and try again.  I hope the information provided today has been helpful. That being said, if you have any other questions please do not hesitate to reach out to me, I am more than happy to help.  On behalf of AWS, have a fantastic day!

10836,8647332711,TATA SIA Airlines Ltd,Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2 - Windows),APAC,INDIA,sayeimr,"Hello Vipin,   This is Imran from AWS Support in Sydney, thanks for your time over chat. It was pleasure assisting you today.  You contacted us today as you wanted to get an instance availability report, specifically information on instance uptime and downtime per instance for the month.  From my investigation I have found that you can use AWS Cost Explorer to get the total amount of hours instances in that account were up and running for, along with the associated cost. You can filter per instance type and per Availability Zone etc. Cost Explorer will retrieve the data from the past 12 months.  To use Cost Explorer to find this data, please follow below: 1) Go to the Cost Explorer console 2) Go to Reports 3) Select Monthly EC2 running hours costs and usage 4) Filter by Tags or instance types.  Unfortunately, you cannot get the downtime of an instance as there is no metric for this.  More information on this can be found at the following link [1], filtering info can be found at the following link [2].  To get the instance up-time from last boot and see how long it has been currently running for, this can be achieved at the OS level. AWS does not have visibility into the OS of an instance for security and privacy as per the AWS Shared Responsibility Model [3]. This will have to be performed on the customers end as we do not have the visibility to do this.  To get the up-time of an instance at the OS level, from an administrative PowerShell session run the following command:       (get-date) - (gcim Win32_OperatingSystem).LastBootUpTime  The output of this command will tell you how long the instance has been running for since its last boot.  To get the last boot time for multiple instances or for a singular instance, you could use AWS Systems Manager Run Command [4] to run the above command across a number of instances. This would remove the need to log onto each instance to run this command individually.

In order to troubleshoot the problem you will need to create an instance with this subnet. The main reason for this requirement is to SSH to an instance present in the same subnet as the instance that you are unable to SSH into and perform network analysis and packet capture tasks from the instance as it will provide more insights on network capture details.  You might also consider initiating a call or chat support from your support dashboard for faster resolution if you would like to perform live troubleshooting as the case will then get routed to earliest available engineer.

As I mentioned over the call, I will close the duplicate case 8651840051 shortly, since we looked at the issue on this case instead.  You got in touch as your instance i-0b82158c49bb4b062 was only seeing 8 vCPUs at the OS level, even though it is running an M5.4xlarge which has 16 vCPUs available.  I explained how an instance with 16 vCPUs is made up of 8 cores each with 2 threads, totaling 16 threads (vCPUs).  From Task Manager and the command line, you could see that only 8 logical processors were being recognised at the OS level.  I asked you to log in to the server to check the registry, so that we could make sure Hyperthreading was enabled.  The registry key in question is as follows:  HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Session Manager\Memory Management  Within this registry key, saw the FeatureSettingsOverride key was set to 0x2048, indicating that Hyperthreading was disabled. This means that from the 8 cores, the machine could only make use of a single thread for each core rather than using both.  To enable Hyperthreading, this value had to be changed to 0, and the machine needs to be rebooted. I gave you the following command to run from an Administrator command prompt:  reg add ""HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Session Manager\Memory Management"" /v FeatureSettingsOverride /t REG_DWORD /d 0 /f   You ran the command and confirmed the value was now 0.  The next step is to perform a reboot of the instance, which you will perform at your next convenience since this is a production server.   Additionally, the CloudWatch metrics were reporting CPU Utilization figures roughly half of the figures you were seeing at the OS level. This is because CloudWatch metrics for EC2 instances are taken from the underlying hardware level itself, not the OS.

I am following up with a quick recap of our conversation.   You reached out to us as you are unable to RDP to instance  i-07bd2af7820d48785. On reviewing the instance details, I confirmed that the security groups and network ACLs allowed traffic from the source machine IP CIDR range (10.35.0.0/16). However, there was no route present in the associated route table rtb-318e6b57 to 10.35.0.0/16. Please add this route via a VGW  to enable traffic flow between this on-premise server and the  instance.  Next, when you tried to RDP into the instance  i-07bd2af7820d48785 from another instance, you were able to get the RDP prompt, however, you were unable to sign in due to the following error ""An Authentication Error has occurred (Code: 0x800004005)"".  As I mentioned, this could be due to various reason such as: 1. Incorrect credentials 2. Time skew between the instance and the DCs. 3. NLA issue due to server losing trust relationship with domain.  We were unable to determine which of the above reasons is the cause as you do not have permissions to make changes to the instance or AWS component. Here are some steps to begin troubleshooting  the issue.  1. Reboot the instance and retry RDP 2. Try logging in with local admin account instead of domain user. 3. If the above steps do not work, you will need to make the instance managed via SSM and troubleshoot it remotely.        a. Create an instance profile: https://docs.amazonaws.cn/en_us/systems-manager/latest/userguide/setup-instance-profile.html#instance-profile-add-permissions       b.

10891,8667743611,HDFC Life Insurance Company Limited,Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2 - Linux),APAC,INDIA,tahriqh,"Hello Rinkesh,  Tahriqh here again, thanks for getting back to me.  I understand that you need a permanent solution for this issue.  Please note that this AMI is configured with the /etc/fstab file having an entry to automatically mount the device by it's device name ""/dev/xvdb1"". This means that if the AMI is launched and the device name is static as ""/dev/xvdb1"", it will work fine.   However, if the device name changes at any time - for example when changing the instance type to a Nitro based instance - the instance will not boot up.  A permanent solution would be to change the /etc/fstab file as suggested in my previous reply and then create a new AMI from that instance to be used going forward, there is no other solution.  If you do not want to use the UUID in the /etc/fstab file, you can also give the device a label and specify that label in the /etc/fstab file - labels also persist across instance types. Instructions:  ----- 1. First you will get the device name:  lsblk  2. Then, you add a label to that device (replace {label} with a label of your choice and {device_name} with the device name you got from lsblk):  sudo tune2fs -L {label} {device_name}  3. Next, add the following entry into your /etc/fstab file to mount the device by its label:  LABEL={YOUR-LABEL}  {/path/to/mount/point}  {file-system-type}  {options} 0 0 -----  This way, you will configure your instance to mount the device according to its label.  If you would like the extra device mounted automatically at boot across different instance types, you will have to specify the mount instruction either by its UUID or by its label, this is the permanent solution and there is no other way around this requirement.  If you have any further questions or need assistance, please let me know, I'm happy to help.  Have a great day further and keep well.  We value your feedback.

I am sharing a brief summary of our discussion on the chat.  You reached out to us because you were not able to telnet from instance ""i-0b3678aed26a78a7d"" to instance "" i-090c32c0cd0248281"" on port 19001-19010  During the chat we discussed that Security groups for the instance were configured correctly to allow traffic from the source to destination and both the instances were in the same VPC and would communicate over the local route in the routing table.   We checked that the issue was for the port range 19001-19010 however the SSH was working fine. We checked if the application was running on the instance and if the port was listening using below command. We found that ports were not listening on the instance.                             $ sudo netstat -tulpen | grep 1900*  You started the application by working with your internal team however the telnet was still not working. We went ahead and checked the firewall on the instance and found that there was a rule to drop all traffic except the allowed rules. We went ahead and added another rule to allow specific for the port 19001 using below command which fixed the issue.                           $ iptables-save > IPtablesbackup.txt                           $ sudo iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 19001 -j ACCEPT   As agreed over the chat, I will be marking this case as resolved.

10940,8678145811,Think and Learn Pvt. Ltd,Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2 - Linux),APAC,INDIA,tkasperc,"Hello,  It is Tomasz again from AWS Premium Support. I hope this email finds you well.  To summarize our calls, there was an issue with a lifecycle hook that has been deleted in one of your AutoScaling groups. Recreating the hook with the same settings as before caused new instances to enter the ""Wait"" state and be terminated after 600 seconds.   We established that the hooks are created automatically by the CodeDeploy service when an ASG is selected in the settings of a code deployment group. The EC2 Console does not allow to specify the ""Notification target ARN"" parameter when creating a new lifecycle hook, so we tried to use the ""put-lifecycle-hook"" command [1] with the ""--notification-target-arn"" parameter. This, however, did not solve the problem - even after specifying the same SQS queue, we still did not see any code deployments getting launched when new instances were created by the ASG.  After testing this in my lab environment, I found that the messages pushed to a CodeDeploy-managed SQS queue must contain a unique identifier that is generated when you associate a deployment group with an ASG. The identifier should be included in the optional metadata section of the given lifecycle hook. Moreover, the name of the hook must be the same as the one that was generated after associating the ASG with the code deployment group. The below command will correctly restore a deleted lifecycle hook:   aws autoscaling put-lifecycle-hook --lifecycle-hook-name GENERATED_NAME --auto-scaling-group-name ASG_NAME --lifecycle-transition autoscaling:EC2_INSTANCE_LAUNCHING --notification-target-arn SQS_ARN --heartbeat-timeout 600 --notification-metadata GENERATED_UNIQUE_ID   I would recommend, however, recreating deleted hooks by editing the given deployment group, removing the associated ASG from the list in the ""Environment configuration"" section, then adding it again and saving the changes.

I understand you are observing increased latency after you have moved your database to Graviton based instances.  I have one theory that may be the cause of this. For your database, do you use encryption in transit, ie: TLS?  Also, when you were using the m5ad/r5ad instance families did you utilize the ephemeral storage, thus the migration changed everything the EBS backed?

[47081846.651506] XFS: nfsd(30561) possible memory allocation deadlock size 131088 in kmem_alloc (mode:0x2400240)     [47081848.655518] XFS: nfsd(30561) possible memory allocation deadlock size 131088 in kmem_alloc (mode:0x2400240)     [47081850.659531] XFS: nfsd(30561) possible memory allocation deadlock size 131088 in kmem_alloc (mode:0x2400240) ...  o Please note that we have no visibility to customer instances at the OS level due to privacy [1] and security [2] reasons it would be difficult for me to point out as to what is exact issue from the OS end.  OS level troubleshooting is a system administration task[3], it is not within the scope of AWS Support. However, In any case, be assured that I will try best to give recommendations base on my analysis of the above logs.  o From the above messages it is evident that the nfsd process is facing issues. The stacks are printed by XFS, which means that nfsd is exporting XFS local filesystem. nfsd process is the nfs-server process which is responsible for fetching the data from the local filesystem and sending it over to the clients that request it. Therefore, issues with nfsd process can cause the issues that youre seeing on the nfs-client.

It was a pleasure assisting you today. I am sending this correspondence as a follow-up to recap what we discussed and to consolidate all the information into one email.  You reached us as you were not able to copy the AMI from your account to different account. We checked the Key policy in your account, and it seemed fine. Later we checked the AMI in the target account and it was successfully shared. We checked the permissions in the target account for your role and added below permissions to your role.   {     ""Sid"": ""AllowUseOfCMKInAccount111122223333"",     ""Effect"": ""Allow"",     ""Action"": [       ""kms:Encrypt"",       ""kms:Decrypt"",       ""kms:ReEncrypt*"",       ""kms:GenerateDataKey*"",       ""kms:CreateGrant"",       ""kms:DescribeKey""     ],     ""Resource"": ""arn:aws:kms:us-west-2:787935213539:key/<key name> }  Then we launched an instance out of the AMI and it was launched successfully. However, when you tried to copy the AMI again in the target account, you were shown the below error:   You do not have permission to access the storage of this ami.  We then added the CreateVolumePermission permissions to the snapshots of the AMI so that the target account is able to copy the AMI. After doing this via console, you again tried to copy the AMI and this time, you were able to copy the AMI.  With this we ended our chat on the note that I can close the case. Hence, Im marking the case as resolved. However, you can reach us again via Premium Support should you have any further queries and we will be happy to assist you further.  We value your feedback.

Upon checking the instance logs, I have noticed that the instance is failing to boot with below error :  Kernel panic - not syncing: Attempted to kill init! exitcode=0x00007f00  As previous engineer shivakumar mentioned below, these kind of kernel panic errors can be seen due to multiple reasons but the most common ones are listed below :  1. The initramfs or initrd image is missing from the newly updated kernel configuration in /boot/grub/grub.conf. Or, the initrd or initramfs file itself is missing from the /boot directory. 2. The kernel or system packages weren't fully installed during the upgrade process due to insufficient space. 3. Third-party modules are missing from the initrd or initramfs image. For example, NVMe, LVM, or RAID modules. 4. Failing to mount filesystems defined in /etc/fstab  During our chat, you have mentioned that the network configuration file was modified and instance started failing after that.

Thank you for your time over the chat today, it was a pleasure assisting you.  It looks like you were no longer available at your desk, hence I had to disconnect the chat at my end. That being said, please find a short summary of our conversation as below:  ============  -- You reached out as you wanted to know the reason behind the high network level data transfer usage corresponding to your instances for the month of July and were looking for an assistance on the same. Upon our conversation, we discussed the following:     -> Using my internal tools, I could confirm that indeed there were high data transfers happening in the mentioned instances i.e. i-017c6a212a27537ce and i-053233c00644a6c2d which is why you were being charged so much for the instance data transfers.     -> Following this, you wished to know of a way by which you can determine the cause of the data transfer (the applications performing this transfer). To this, we discussed that AWS Premium Support engineers dont have resource level access due to the data privacy policy we follow. Hence, in order to check this youll need to install network monitoring tools inside the instances and log the network data transfer data inside the instance so that you can access and identify the applications causing this data transfer.     -> Upon checking further, I could see that the instances in question were windows OS based instance. We discussed, that since Im from the EC2 linux team, I dont have an expertise in handling Windows instances and hence dont have much idea on the tools and techniques you can use to get this data from your instances.  That being said, I mentioned that it would be best for you to raise a case with the windows team as they would have a better expertise and visibility in assisting you with this query moving forward.  ============  Hope this helps.

Please find below a brief summary of our chat.  You had contacted us as you were receiving ""packet_write_wait: Connection to 18.237.18.61 port 22: Broken pipe"" when executing a script on the instance ""i-073eb68b6ea0d102f"".  The message that you mentioned is noticed when SSH connection (on port 22) was cut off due to a long period of inactivity. To mitigate this you can use the ClientAliveInterval and ServerAliveInterval i.e. in the ""/etc/ssh/sshd_config"" file in the instance, you can add the following lines:   ClientAliveInterval 300  ClientAliveCountMax 2   This will send a ping every 300 seconds (5 minutes) and disconnect after 2 failures. So the ping will keep the connection alive and active and will not time-out.

It was a pleasure talking to you over the chat/WebEx.  To summarize our call, you would like to know if there are any filesystem issues for the mentioned instances ""i-009e746fdc0a5f24f11, i-0dee70bc692a9cf8511, i-0f1b5e7bd8704641e11, i-091db20382753dc45"".  As discussed over WebEx, all the instances are passing status checks and we do not see any issues with CPU utilization as well, the console logs looks fine and I do not see any memory fragmentation or out of memory errors. The only thing we noticed is the EBS root volume is having more read IOPS then the desired IOPS which is today and this could be because of multiple restarts on the instances. But for the mentioned time which is August 14th 11AM IST, which is 5:30 AM UTC, I do not see any IOPS which are breathing or throttling the threshold limit of the EBS volumes.

11073,8732057221,Axis Bank Limited,Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2 - Linux),APAC,INDIA,hsaluja,"Hello Shardul,  Thank you for contacting AWS Support. It was nice working with you today.  To summarize, you were looking to understand the reason of your EMR cluster master node: i-0a237432abe5dfaf2 failing its status checks and becoming unreachable earlier today, as you mentioned that this has happened previously too.   During our chat session, I reviewed the instance and noticed its failed its instance status check between 13:00 and 13:50 UTC. [1] This instance level status check typically indicates an issue with the instance's operating system, like file system level issues, resource contention / over utilization (disk i/o, memory, cpu).   Next, I checked the console logs available to me, and found multiple counts of ""out of memory"" errors. I requested you to check those yourself by going to the EC2 console > Selecting the instance > Actions > Monitor and Troubleshoot > Get System Log. These ""out of memory"" errors show that the operating system ran out of memory, and therefore the kernel killed processes through ""oom-killer"". To learn more about this, please see [2]. We also looked at the ""mem_used_percent"" CloudWatch custome metric [3] being published from the instance, and saw a spike in memory utilization reaching almost 100%.   Further, I looked at the EBS volumes attached to the instance, and observed high disk I/O on vol-0337f1c4bd6d928db. There was an increase in the VolumeReadOps [4] around the incident time frame, and this volume used / depleted all of its burst credits as well. [5] This means that there was high disk activity on the instance, and this volume was pushing more than its baseline performance of 300 IOPS thus using its burst credits. Once the burst balance depletes, the performance of the volume is reduced to its baseline performance, so if the workload/application running at the OS end still continues to push more IOPS than this could make the instance unreachable. You can learn more about I/O credits and Burst Balance at [6].  In short summary, it appears the instance became unreachab",8/16/2021 0:00,8/16/2021 0:00,RE:[CASE 8732057221] EMR Master node instance went into 1/2 state,1,,hello shardul thank contacting aws support wa nice working today summarize looking understand reason emr cluster master node failing status check becoming unreachable earlier today mentioned ha happened previously chat session reviewed instance noticed failed instance status check instance level status check typically indicates issue instance operating system like file system level issue resource contention utilization disk memory next checked console log available found multiple count memory error requested check going ec2 console selecting instance action monitor troubleshoot get system log memory error show operating system ran memory therefore kernel killed process oom killer learn please see also looked cloudwatch custome metric published instance saw spike memory utilization reaching almost looked eb volume attached instance observed high disk wa increase volumereadops around incident time frame volume used depleted burst credit well mean wa high disk activity instance volume wa pushing baseline performance iop thus using burst credit burst balance depletes performance volume reduced baseline performance workload application running end still continues push iop could make instance unreachable learn credit burst balance short summary appears instance became unreachab,9,pleasure premium inconvenience underlying feel contacting hope happy conversation chatting corner incoming reviewed star rated experience ahead rating assisting talking

This is Sarvani and I am writing this email to summarize our conversation.  You have reached out to us as you are getting dependency issues when running the command 'apt install build-essential' and need assistance to fix the same.  During our chat, I confirmed that I am able to install build-essential package on my test ec2 instance launched from the same AMI as yours without any issues. On screen-share session, we took a backup of the instance by creating an AMI(ami-0900224b111702915). Then, we ran the same commands again and noticed that the package has dependencies on libc6-dev, gcc and g++ versions.  We tried to install these packages and could not install them on your instance. Also, we ran the following command to move the file in ""/etc/apt/sources.list.d/"" to different file name as here:   # mv google-chrome.list.save.1 1.google-chrome.list.save  Even after making these changes, we are unable to update the libc6-dev and install build-essential packages. Thus, I did some research and found some third-party articles, which might be helpful in resolving this issue:  [+] https://askubuntu.com/questions/937254/cannot-install-build-essential-gcc-g-after-upgrade-to-17-04  [+] https://serverfault.com/questions/993576/debian-apt-install-build-essential-fails-because-of-unmet-dependencies  Since, these are third-party articles, AWS cannot guarantee the integrity of the same. Thus, I would recommend you to test these in your test machine before applying to the production environment. Also, as your instance have custom configurations in ""/etc/apt/sources.list.d/"", I have recommended you to involve your System Administrator to test the steps outlined above as they will have better understanding of your setup. Also package installation is a System admin task and falls out of scope of AWS Support[1]. However, I tried to help you on a best-effort basis to resolve this issue.

[+] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/latest/application/load-balancer-troubleshooting.html#http-504-issues  Over the screen sharing session, we have followed the below troubleshooting steps to isolate the issue.  # Initially, I found that i-0fd08ff7af2e7ad78 was reported as unhealthy in ELB but after sometime it was returned to healthy state. # Performed the application load tests and got the same 504 errors. # This time i-07d6299ac53708c55 was reported as unhealthy. RDP the instance and tried browsing the website locally but it was not working. Restarted the website from IIS console then instance was healthy. #  Performed the application load tests again and then got the same issue on i-0fd08ff7af2e7ad78.  Conclusion ---------------------  With respect to the ELB and EC2 side, I did not find any issues however, the issue seems to be related to website code or IIS service (due to the load website is getting hung or not responding to the requests and its causing the 504 errors). Further, your application team is going to review the code and investigate the issue.

Phumlani again, please see below a summary of our chat.  You reached out to us because your Ec2 windows server  i-040b4a60922286251 failed instance status checks. This happened after modifying the root volume and making changes within the OS to reflect the newly modified size.  We went on a chime call to troubleshoot this issue, and we did the following to resolve the issue.   1. We used a helper instance to attach the affected root volume.  2. From disk management I noticed that there are two partitions, we made the D: partition active.  3. We also executed Ec2Rescue[1] tool to restore from last known good configuration.  4. Detached the volume and attached  it to the original server  i-040b4a60922286251.  The server started successfully and passed both instance and system status checks.  Once again I would like to thank you for your patience while we have been working on this case over the chime call.   Additionally, the security group of your instances allows incoming traffic to TCP port 3389 from Anywhere. This leaves your instance vulnerable to attacks. In particular, this Windows vulnerability attack directed at RDP port (TCP 3389). Therefore, I recommend that you immediately lock down the port(s) by editing your security group rules to only allow traffic from specific sources, i.e., the IP or CIDR blocks of your client.[2]  As agreed on chat I will go ahead and resolve the case, If you have any other concerns please feel free to open a case with us we will be more than happy to assist you further.

11122,8749238971,Sony Pictures Networks India Pvt Ltd,Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2 - Windows),APAC,INDIA,katyalc,"Hello Pranit,  Thanks for your time over the chat today, I just wanted to send a follow-up email recapping our conversation. You initiated the chat as you wanted to know how to create an AMI of domain joined production instance (i-0df0c495603b77908).   As discussed, for domain joined Windows instances it is recommended to perform a sysprep using EC2config (for Windows 2012 R2 or lower) and EC2launch (for windows 2016 or above). This is done because all the Windows machines have their own SID which should be unique and if you do not perform a sysprep before creating an image then all the instance deployed using that AMI will have the same SID and machine name which will cause issues for the domain joined machines. Please refer to Microsoft articles [1] & [2] for more information on what sysprep does. Please refer to the article [3] for detailed steps on how to create an AMI for Windows EC2 instances.   Further, please find the procedure to create an AMI for windows 2016 production EC2 instance:  1) Create an AMI of existing production instance [4].  2) Launch a new instance using the AMI created in step 1 in an isolated subnet (no access to other subnets or Microsoft AD).  3) Perform a sysprep on the instance created in step 2 using the reference link [5].  4) Create a new AMI using the syspreped EC2 instance.  5) Now you can use this AMI to deploy further production instances and join them to the domain.   Please note you will need local administrator credentials of production instance in order to login to the helper instance created in Step 2. If you do not have local administrator credentials then I would suggest you to create a new local user on production instance and add it to local administrators group before creating an AMI from it in step 1.  I trust I was able to answer all your queries related to the case. Please let me know if you have any further queries/concerns regarding this case and I would be happy to assist.

11126,8749733801,One97 Communications Limited,Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2 - Linux),APAC,INDIA,pikabu,"Hello,  Thank you for reaching out to AWS support my name is Peter and this is a recap from our chat.  You wanted to find out why there was no connectivity between your two instances after a recent Security Group update.  During my investigation i checked the instances Security Groups and found out that there was no outbound ports allowing for the source instance to communicate with the destination instance. No out bound  meant that the source system wasn't able to establish any connection with the destination instance.  I tested this out in my environment by creating two instances and modifying Security Group to only allow outbound to specific ports to my second instance. Once I had the port opened I used netcat to open the port on the destination instance and used telnet on the source instance to test communication.  You were able to update your Security Group rules to allow TCP port ranges to the destination hosts CIDR range and you tested the connection with telnet and connection had resumed. You mentioned the changes were from an old security group that was working and you had simply reverted to them.  TCP 0 - 65535 10.114.0.0/16 test, should be removed  This rule was the one that allowed traffic to flow from the source to destination. You can modify this rule to only include the specific ports you need open .  For security group rules, you have to remember to open needed ports, if you are only allowing specific ports outbound, you must allow for each port or port range if you intend for communication with other instances[1].  At the end of the chat you were able to confirm everything works and you mentioned it was okay to close this case.

My name is Bharath, and I am just following up with a short summary of our chat today. You contacted us because you were unable to send mail from your EC2 instance.   Upon initial investigation, I confirmed that all the configuration from the instance looked good and there was no blockage from the AWS side.   After that we joined a screenshare session to understand your setup, we then analyzed the postfix server and found that there was an issue with the configuration. Therefore, we removed postfix and then reinstalled it.   Once we installed it, we configured it using this [1] guide. We were able to successfully send an email after configuring it.   As discussed on chat, I will be closing this case since this is not related to AWS.   Should you have additional questions or concerns, please get back to us, and we will be happy to assist you.

It was pleasure chatting with you today.   To summarize, you reached out to us as one of the instance got terminated automatically from the ASG and would like to know the root cause.   EC2 has detected underlying hardware issue on the affected instance few days ago and it got terminated due to scheduled retirement after 2021-08-22 04:00:00 UTC. A PHD notification was sent on 08-Aug-2021 regarding this scheduled retirement with the following message.  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ EC2 has detected degradation of the underlying hardware hosting your Amazon EC2 instance associated with this event in the us-east-1 region. Due to this degradation your instance could already be unreachable. We will stop your instance after 2021-08-22 04:00:00 UTC. Please take appropriate action before this time. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  Upon reviewing your PHD, I also noticed another open issue like ""EC2 AutoScaling launch template not found"". I suggested you to review and take appropriate action.   I hope I was able to answer your questions today. As discussed, I am closing this case as there is no further required from AWS side.
